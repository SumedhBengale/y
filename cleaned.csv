No compensation and apoligies are made. I have been driving two Tesla S and one Tesla X the past 12 years. I've only put up with this treatment because of the lack of competition.

They are not registered with the Motor Ombudsman, and do not have any code of conduct for customer service. They do not have any mechanism to register any complaints. They are using the loophole in motoring industry, as perhaps the only business not having signed up to regulator. So you cannot take your grievance to any regulator. The only way to escalate would be to take legal action, which in most cases is disproportionately expensive and time consuming. If any of you can succeed in even registering a formal complaint with Tesla, that would be a great triumph. This is all the more important as their customer service is absolutely appalling.

I was super surprised because this had never happened before. I tried to contact support through the Tesla app and they sent a tow truck to supposedly tow the car to the nearest Tesla dealership but the person Tesla sent was from a third party company and he just opened the car and charged it for 3 minutes on the battery in the front of the car and said it was fixed and there was no need to tow it to Tesla. I told him I had to work in the afternoon and if it was safe to drive he said yes and left.When I went to work I was surprised again with several alerts on the car saying that it was not safe to drive, once again I contacted support and the attendant Adrian told me that he could not send another tow truck because I denied the service for In the morning, the person who came told me that there was no need to take the car, so I asked the supervisor Daniel who told me the same thing that if I wanted the towing service I would have to pay and Tesla would not provide it. After more than an hour of calling and NOTHING being resolved, I still can't use the car and no one can solve my problem at Tesla.I am very upset with this situation, I believed that Tesla was attentive to its customers.

Don’t treat people like they are fool if you can not deliver a car in 1.5 month. No one answers or probably has any knowledge about their internal supply chain either.

Inwas given a quote for my trade in. They made me put down $250 non refundable then I found the trade-in value offered for the second time to be very low! I find it unfair and disheartening that Tesla requires customers to pay an upfront fee of $250 before providing them with a trade-in value. Furthermore, the inconsistency in the initial trade-in value quote, which changed from $19000 to $15000 within just three weeks, raises concerns about the transparency of Tesla's valuation process.I kindly request that Tesla reconsider its policy of charging customers upfront for trade-in assessments. It would greatly improve the customer experience if Tesla could provide trade-in value estimates before requiring any financial commitment or ordering a car!!

They have messed me about for weeks before xmas booking and cancelling the appointment three times and eventually booking a home visit on the 02/01/24 between 8am and 12pmI had to take a day off from work – unpaid I should say – for short notice and they never turned up; no calls or emails to advise on that and I had to stay at home like an idiot all day waiting for them not showing up…….obviously they never did as day after new year’s I assume someone was too hungover to provide the correct service!!!But hey what do I know, I could be wrong. For the records they costed me £279 for that unpaid day they made me take!! I complained to them and told them exactly what I thought about their pathetic cyber service and how p*** I was because of their doing,  For the records also when I took the car in few months back for a rattling noise took me over a month to book the appointment and their messaged me via the app for weeks asking me to drive the vehicle and record with a phone the noise the car was making…..just to give you an idea of their level on intelligence and accuracy when assisting customers and their cars. This was at the North Shields branch at Vroom, Orion business park, Units 6-7, North Shields NE29 7TE. Pathetic so-called mechanics that have no clue on how to interact with people, let alone servicing a vehicle.Like I said they asked me to drive the vehicle with that noise I reported and record it whilst driving, so that they could hear it…..absolutely morons!!! Any other respectable garage centre would have asked to bring the car in for assessment and they would have test drive it themselves to find out the noise and what it may have been….at Tesla NORTH SHIELDS you need to record the noise whilst driving…..very safe advice!!!!!The online app support and customer service is appalling – You cant speak with a anyone at all, as the system its set up to force you to use the app and cant interact with any person, either at your local centre or at H/O.Total non-sense because the tesla app seems to be manned by chatbots and robots that only knows how to reject without even saying the problem. atrocious customer service again and again. Keep cancelling mobile service appointments after making us wait the whole time, last one booked for the 2nd of Jan 2024 and made me take time off work that cost me £327….they never showed up, never contacted me to tell me they weren’t coming nor emailed me or phoned me. Absolute bunch of cowboys at the North Shields centre….total ignorant rude and unprofessional . There is no way to lodge a complaint (conveniently as they purposely void those consumer rights), nothing on website, no postal address, no email address, chat is not answered by anyone other than a default computer that gives you pre-set answers. do not seem to subscribe to any regulator like Motoring Ombudsman…again convenient!!!This is effectively an unregulated business, which is scandalous. Tried to book a service via the tesla app and I keep receiving a message – I am guessing from the default computer – saying that they are rejecting all services and cancelling all appointments in my name as a spite because I challenged their poor pathetic service.They cant handle been found wrong and take childish actions against you by denying services….probably because they impaired to carry them out to be fair.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,ale,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/63bc1a1829f88f0013b9c79f/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

However, my experience has been anything but smooth, marked by a series of unfortunate incidents and what I perceive as inadequate customer service.Windshield Woes: Within the first month, I encountered a mysterious crack in the front windshield. Tesla's assessment attributed it to a rock strike – an explanation I found perplexing and somewhat unsatisfactory. The responsibility for repair costs, amounting to approximately $2000, fell entirely on me, a disheartening outcome for such a new purchase.Tire Troubles on the Road: My drive from Redmond, WA to Portland, OR was abruptly interrupted by a blown tire – a stressful situation exacerbated by a blizzard. Tesla's roadside assistance was far from comforting; their suggestion to book a hotel and wait for service was impractical given the severe weather conditions and my family's well-being. Although they eventually sent a service truck to replace the tire, their insistence on taking the damaged tire to their service center was another point of frustration.Compounded by the discovery of a second damaged tire, with an additional cost of $420 for replacements, the ordeal was a significant inconvenience. It disrupted our family routine, causing us to miss work and school.Comparing Experiences: Reflecting on my ownership of cars from other brands like Nissan, Toyota, and Honda, I can't recall facing such issues. My decision to switch to Tesla was driven by a desire to embrace environmentally friendly technology and to benefit from the purported long-term economical advantages of an electric vehicle. However, this series of events has led me to question my decision.As of now, I'm left with the task of coordinating the retrieval of my tire from Portland and addressing the bubble in the second tire, which renders my car undriveable. It's a reminder that every purchase, especially one as significant as a vehicle, comes with its own set of challenges.In Conclusion: This review is a candid account of my experience as a Tesla owner. It's not just about the technical difficulties, but also about the expectation of support and service that should accompany any high-end product. I remain hopeful for a resolution and believe that sharing my story might help others in making informed decisions. My journey with Tesla continues, and I'm eager to see if the coming weeks bring about a change in my current perspective.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Rizwan Awan,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/65b1b04262c130001247dcef/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

It was honestly the worst time of my life. £110,000 and never once was it problem/hassle free. Tesla “repaired” the wiring loom in 2021 and ever since it’s had issues. After 16 service visits for electrical and drivetrain issues which never got fixed I took it upon myself to strip the vehicle down and I found the repair from Tesla service centre in Milton Keynes was to blame. At this time they “repaired” this loom although I asked for it to be replaced, they assured me it would be fine and they are not willing to replace the loom. I found this very strange on a car under 6 months old. Anyway at the same time they repaired this loom they damaged the whole side of my model X and it needed a full respray. I requested they took the vehicle back at this point but you can not speak to anyone who cares or listens and had no choice but to have them spray the vehicle. They NEVER want to help always looking for that way out. I absolutely hate this company with a passion. Great product idea with terrible business outfit. Service from Tesla has made my life a misery for 3 years. My car had constant issues. It still groans and feels very unsafe. They have replaced driveshafts multiple times, wheels, tyres, drive units.

When it works it’s amazing, comfortable, fast, stylish…. It was reliable. But on Nov 4th 2023, I had my 12 volt replaced on my Model S. They came to the house and replaced it in about 2 hours. The guy never talked to me but then I got a message in my Tesla app saying I had to bring it in for service. I thought that was strange having just seen the Tesla worker in my driveway. Apparently he had stripped some bolt that the battery connects to the fuse box. I bring it to Tesla on Dec 4th and the service department worker tells me “oh so sorry, you should not have come today, we don’t have the part and we don’t even have a date of when it will arrive”. So I ask what part? How much will it cost? He said I have to replace my entire fuse box and it will cost over $800. Why am I being charged for the service workers actions? I’ve never even seen this bolt or fuse box, he touched it and presumably damaged it and I have to pay for it???? So they rescheduled my appt to January 8th. Yesterday, my car is giving me an error “Unable to drive, voltage too low”. I reached out through the app because Tesla refuses to make it easy for customers to talk to factory employees and it’s been almost 24 hours with no response. Meanwhile, I have a very expensive car sitting in my driveway that I can’t even move it to a more convenient location. Teslas customer service is the worst I’ve ever dealt with when it comes to cars.

Unfortunately, Tesla recently reduced the price by approximately 15.7%, causing my purchase to result in a loss as my car is now worth less than the new price. When I attempted to sell the vehicle, I received incredibly low offers ranging from $29,000 to $36,000, resulting in a loss of around 50% in just one year. This indicates that the car's value will be exceedingly low in the market in the coming years.Furthermore, the warranty service provided by Tesla is terrible. I scheduled an appointment due to a noise in the front, but they informed me that it was normal and that the noise started a month ago. When I tried to go to another dealer, they wanted to charge me $167 because Tesla does not cover unexpected vehicle noises under warranty. As a result, I am now stuck with a 2022 car with noises that I cannot claim because the warranty does not cover it. I suggest waiting for a better EV vehicle with a decent warranty that prioritizes taking care of customers over making money. Tesla does not provide loan cars, making it impossible to do any kind of DIY mechanic work since they are the only ones controlling the parts. After all this, I decided to sell the car and stop supporting a company that doesn't support the customer.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Hector Marrero,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5846eb200000ff000a5eb5b1/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

The incompetence displayed in their communication process is beyond belief. First and foremost, the finance figures presented on their website did not align with the reality I faced—a mysterious increase of £31 per month with zero explanation.To add insult to injury, the app requested exhaustive part exchange details only to inform me later that I couldn't part exchange my car because I was ordering a contract hire vehicle. This lack of coherence left me questioning the entire transaction.Attempting to communicate with Tesla over text messages proved almost laughable. It felt like a pointless endeavor, as I found myself endlessly repeating the same information without any resolution in sight. If this is the level of customer service before taking delivery, one can only imagine what the aftercare might entail.Regrettably, my experience has led to a complete loss of confidence in Tesla, prompting me to cancel my order.

There literally is zero customer service. I purchased a 2023 Model 3 which was in itself a very much technology driven experience which wouldn’t be bad except that complete removal of the human element leaves one having to rely on unreliable sources to answer questions. Currently I have been facing an issue with obtaining the documents I signed at purchase. I asked the Tesla delivery person for copies at the time of delivery and was told they had no way to give me copies. However, I was assured that all of the documents would be uploaded and available via my Tesla account. Well they aren't. My insurance company is requiring a copy of the NC odometer disclosure statement showing the vehicle was new and the mileage at purchase. Of course this document has not been uploaded. When I try contacting my local showroom where I purchased the vehicle, I get a voicemail saying no one is available to take the call and to leave a message and someone would return my call. However, the mailbox has been full for quite some time and I have been unable to leave a message. When you call the national customer care number it asks for your zip code, then routes you right back to your local showroom. There is absolutely no customer service whatsoever. I replied to the after sale survey and blasted them with very detailed responses of my experience and of course there has been no response to that. The online chat is for sales only and the minute you ask about post sale issues the chat representative says they will have someone reach out to you and then they immediately end the chat. Of course no one ever actually reaches out. It is very sad to see a company with so much potential and such a great product being run in such an abysmal fashion with no care or concern after getting your money. This is my first and last Tesla and advise anyone looking at purchasing one to stay away.

We got one after another misinformation only to find out that all we were told was wrong after we put $30k downpaymet and went to pickup our brand new Model Y.1. Rushed us into making reservation online without promo code that we had, saying that all can be rectified later. It couldn't - same person that told us it could, said I'm sorry we can't add promo code now (unless we are willing to lose those $250 we placed for reservation), so we lost perk they offered at that time: 6 months of free Supercharge.2. Said we will get state tax deducted from our price. That was not true. When we said it's not true so we will be paying interest on full amount he said we will get it when they deliver the car. Again NOT TRUE. You get everything when you get your tax return. Other EVs deduct full amount from the price point, just fyi.3. Said insurance (bought through Tesla) is about $180 a month, it's well over $200.à4.

After few months of driving a rattling sound developed in the car that comes from within a dashboard to the left of the steering wheel. When i picked it up from the dealership, I did not have that issue. The car is still under warranty. When i took it to the service to rotate tires and fix the issue, the technician was able to reproduce the issue within couple of minutes driving the car. They sent a message the same day stating that the car was ready, and the rattle noise is a normal sound of that particular part. I told them that I did not have that noise upon picking up the new car from the dealership, and now i get this sound. They refused to fix it and continue stating that it is a normal sound. I have lot of friends that have Teslas (same and different models), none of them have this 'normal' noise. I did some research on this, and lot of users reported this issue online. Some of them got it fixed by the service. When i brought it up to the service manager and asked why am i being discriminated since it has been fixed for some in the past, he hung up the phone on me. When i tried to call back, they recognized my number and put me on hold right away. I was on hold for 60 minutes, then they just disconnected the call. I paid over $60k for the car that i hate driving since it sounds like an old carriage while riding on every little bump. There is a way to fix this. Someone recorded a great video how to do that, but this is something that should be covered by the warranty and not something that each driver would have to do.

Once we had arranged a delivery time, I had a phone call on the morning of delivery to say there was an issue with the collection team and someone from Tesla would have to drive the vehicle to our site - putting mileage onto our brand new car. Later that morning I had another call to say they had noticed some scratches on the bonnet.  They would still have to deliver the car, but said they would assist in arranging the repair works to be carried out.This gave us a sinking feeling and certainly not a wow factor usually expected when purchasing a brand new car.The car arrived later that day, and indeed had scratches on the bonnet.   the lady delivering the car told us to download the app and request a service visit, but was no help whatsoever with this and just left us to it. We asked whether the car would be collected from us, but was told no - we have to take it ourselves and also there would not be any kind of courtesy car offered.

Tesla doesn't care.,"I purchased a new Tesla Model 3 in July 2023 and quickly learned that Tesla has some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced. First, Tesla doesn't let you test drive your car before accepting delivery, so you just have to hope the car you're purchasing from them doesn't have any significant issues. I drove 3 hours away to accept delivery of my Model 3, and on the way home, I noticed that the cameras would crash at times, disengaging Autopilot, and the GPS would freeze while this was happening as well. After a few days with the car, I realized this issue was occurring whenever I hit bumps in the road and I scheduled a service appointment. The Service Center claims there is a bad connection internal to the car computer and it must be replaced. However, they said that the computer is hard to come by and have no ETA on when it may arrive. It's been over 2 weeks now since my service appointment and the Service Center has not been able to provide any updates or an ETA on the replacement computer. From what I've read online, some have waited 3+ months for a replacement. So, now I have a brand new car that half works and Tesla could not care less. Quality control is obviously lacking for a car to have been delivered with this issue in the first place, but the fact that Tesla continues to churn new cars out and doesn't care to stock parts for vehicles it has already sold says a lot about how much they care about their customers.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,newteslaproblems,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/64d62bd64e60170012e6c89c/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

I bought into the Cult, joined the Tesla Owners Club, read all of the eulogies on social media. After six months waiting, I finally took ""delivery"" of my Y (they don't actually deliver your £58K Car; they keep their costs down by getting you to drive to one of their ""pop up"" delivery centres, where there's no handover, no opportunity to inspect the vehicle and your battery will only be charged to 50%). Seven months later, after a low velocity collision, my Insurance Company have had to write off my car as it's too expensive to repair. Three months later, my replacement vehicle arrives (I had no choice as Tesla's depreciate more than any other brand), only for Tesla to text me an hour later informing me that the car is being repossessed as the Insurance Company haven't paid the invoice (they had and provided Tesla with evidence). I have had to arrange for another hire car as the replacement Tesla on my drive, is going to be repossessed by them. They are an absolute joke of a Company, whom I am sure will no longer be manufacturing EV's in a few years time as they are being eclipsed by established car manufacturers.

Despite some built-in safety features, the 2022 Tesla Model 3 was a nightmare to drive for a rental or to buy for the following reasons:1) I would not pay $75k for a car that is terribly noisy to drive because the seals around the windows do not work.  Worst than my 20 years convertible Mercedes, Lexus, and Toyota I have or had in my life.2) In addition, it is not the most friendly and intuitive car as Tesla believed they have manufactured.  I had an opportunity to rent a Tesla on my trip to Texas for a house hunting trip.  The Hertz rental company offered me a Tesla for a week at a very reasonable price.  I thought, ""Wow! how lucky can I get!""  Wrong...  They had no one to give me a quick 5 min lesson on how to start or operate the car.  They handed me a scan code for me to download the operating manual to my phone and tried to figure things out on my own.  Ok...  so it was not as intuitive as they think.  It took me half an hour to figure out how to turn the car on and maneuver through their navigation system and where to find all the buttons to operate this car.  3) Tesla charging stations were a night mare compares to high gasoline price we had to pay in California.  As a new comer to Texas, I had no idea where I was going let alone which area is safe in the early morning or late at night to go and find these stations to get the car charged up.  Also, once I found a near by supercharging station, it took me over an hour to charge the first full power at 34 cents a kwh...  that's over $18 for a full battery which allowed me to make 2 round trips from Houston to Humble with a about 8% power left to make you nervous enough to start driving to a charing station.  This equates to about 3 full hours drive.  The 2nd charge only took about 20 minutes for me to fill up the battery to return the car on the way to the airport.  The only available super charging station was actually the Tesla Customer Service building about 20 min round-trip out from the George Bush Airport.  That was fine, until I found out that the max level I could only charge at this station is 80%.  Ok...  at 3AM, trying to return the car and get to the airport to make my 5AM flight, I was not about to drive around to find another chargimg station.  I explained this to Hertz, but I don't know if they charged me $35 for not returning the car with full battery power.  I am still waiting for my final bills from Hertz.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,MongThu Pham,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/6542793cacebc00012268960/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

I asked for a return call which came quickly.  I paid my $250 fee/opportunity to buy the car.  I was directed to the app and told it would be a breeze to fill out and I could get my car in a couple of days as it was in inventory and I was paying cash.  I was told I could call back if there were any issues.  The app rejected the correct insurance company code it asked for.  I called back innocently thinking someone would help me.  Nothing.  Five days of nothing.  I started a new order.  Someone called me, oh yes sorry, there was a mix up on your last order, we will call you back and straighten everything out.  Four more days.  Given a new offer with a friends referral bonus that was more expensive than without the bonus.  Given extremely unclear explanations for things on the level of childish cover-ups, making dogs eating homework sound more real.  Decided I better read some reviews before spending on this.  Glad I did.  I never have seen so many 1 star reviews wishing they could be 0.  I am older and experience has shown me that one of the worst feelings you can have is being cheated and lied to.  No matter how good the drive of the car might be I could see that it would take me to that feeling sooner or later as it has so many other people.  Saying that Tesla is making the world less contaminated is not accurate.  Their way of doing business is highly contaminating, lacking humanity and integrity, financial responsibility and training people to avoid genuine customer interface.  This is the Brave New World and it is not a pretty one.  This is not to be admired because it makes someone rich and famous, it is sad because the wiz bang technology is being sold by cutting all the corners off of decent looking-people-in-the-eye relationships.

We had a flat tire on route 22 in NJ and we called Tesla road side assistance.  After zillions of questions that we had to get through we finally got them to dispatch a tow truck to come to the scene.  They promised 65 minutes, but it actually took 2 and half hours for the tow truck to arrive. But that's not the end of story.  After we got to the Tesla service center in Sprinfiled of NJ, they told us that they didn't have the tires for our car, which is just standard 19"" continental tire for Model Y.  They say we had to wait for 2 or 3 days for them to get the tires.  What? A Telsa service center doesn't have regular tesla tires? We could have tried Costco tire shop nearby that would have immediately replaced our tires for a regular non EV car.  This is beyond ridiculous. Moreover, since Tesla does not provide spare tire, we had had to already drive a few miles to get off the road which caused more problems then just replacing the tiresSince we are on a road trip, we had to call an Uber to take us to a nearby hotel to stay there until they got the tires!!So guys, don't buy a Tesla or any EV for that matter.

Not only are their products sub par but their customer service is the absolute pits!I’ve owned testa cars for over 6 years and I’m quite disappointed in how they age badly. Now I can see that the Wall Connector Home charging station is also the pits. I purchased my first one when I bought my Tesla model Y. Three months after the 4 year warranty expired the charger stopped working. When I contacted Tesla about servicing it I was told they do not service it and that I would need to buy another. I went out and bought another for $500 and paid an electrician $500 to install it. Unfortunately the unit turned out to be defective. I called their tech support and they had me troubleshoot it and told me it was defective and they would send me a replacement. I asked them if it could be expedited because charging my 2 electric cars at a PMU lic charger is twice as costly as charging at home. They said they would request it. Eight days later I received the replacement. I followed the instructions to install the replacement only to find out it didn’t work. I called their tech supply again (open only 9am-4pm Monday to Friday meeting I need to take time off work to do so) only to be told this one was defective as well and would have ti be replaced again. When I told them I did not want to wait another 8 days to receive a replacement and asked to speak with a supervisor they said one would get back to me in 25-48 hours. It’s now been 4 days and still no call back from a supervisor.Do yourself a favor and stay away from Tesla as a company in general. Their customer service is just as arrogant as the owner of the company and you will be suffering owning their products all along. If you already own one do yourself a favor of selling it before the market price drops and you’re stuck with a dud.,,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Michael Shriqui,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/6505f2599d6ef90012fbcdf3/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

On the night of October 17th, I encountered system errors in the Tesla app. Unfortunately, I didn't think much of it at the time, but my world came crashing down the next morning when I tried to get my kids to school and head to work, only to discover that my brand-new EV had completely shut down. I couldn't even open the doors.In desperation, I contacted Tesla's roadside assistance, who promptly towed my car to the service center. During that call, I was informed that the issue was likely a faulty V12 battery, and I was assured that they would quickly replace it, allowing me to get back on the road the same day. Hopeful, I checked in at the service center and was told that there was an ""isolated event"" that needed attention, and my car would be ready for pickup on October 19th. They provided me with a loaner, and I thought my woes would be short-lived.Unfortunately, the nightmare had only just begun. The next day, I received an update, informing me that my car was still under diagnostic, and the pickup date was rescheduled to October 20th. This pattern continued. The date was pushed further to October 23rd, and as time passed, my frustration grew. When I asked for details about the issue, I was informed that they needed to replace the drive unit, which sounded serious. Despite my protests and concerns, they assured me it would be a quick fix since the car was already partially disassembled, and they were awaiting the part's delivery.As the week progressed, the pickup date kept shifting, with no end in sight. I was shocked that a company known for its technological prowess couldn't seem to track their part shipments effectively. On Friday, I received multiple messages detailing the service progress, and they promised to have my car ready by 6 pm. However, my excitement was short-lived when I received a call at 6:45 pm, informing me that they were working overtime to complete the quality control checks.I expressed my frustration, explaining that I couldn't just wait around for an indefinite period. The person on the phone understood my concerns but suggested I could pick up the car over the weekend or the following week if I was too busy. This was frustrating, especially as I had already been forced to cancel a road trip due to the limitations of the loaner vehicle, which could only cover 200 miles per day.Finally, I received a text at 7 pm, stating that my car was ready, and I was provided with contactless pickup instructions. However, this was marred by the threat that I would be charged for the parking spot for my car and the loaner if I didn't pick up within 24 hours, which directly contradicted what I had been told on the phone.When I picked up my car on Saturday, I was greeted by a dirty interior with shoe marks on the liners and greases on the inside of driver's side door. This was a stark contrast to my previous experiences with car services, where protective measures were taken to ensure the vehicle's cleanliness.Overall, the entire experience left me extremely frustrated and dissatisfied. My brand-new Tesla Model Y Performance was rendered inoperable for a substantial period of time, and I was provided with no clear explanation for the issue. Additionally, the service I received fell well below expectations, and it was evident that little care was taken to ensure the customer's satisfaction and the car's cleanliness. This experience has left a bitter taste in my mouth, and I hope that Tesla can improve their service standards to match the caliber of their products.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Nate Le,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/64e5a3ce2acd740012bfda34/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

The most common being the Model 3 and Y.I have interviewed and asked questions of every Tesla owner I have met in person. Most of them are happy with their Tesla car, and have very little complaints. One couple owned a Tesla Model X for 6 YEARs, and had zero problems and only had to change their tires. ZERO maintenance other than cleaning the car. A model 3 owner told me he was going to upgrade to a Model Y, and he loved his Tesla model 3. He wanted to upgrade for more cargo space of the model Y.I applaud the risk Elon took in pioneering the EV market, when no one else dared to. Now there are hundreds of EV models to choose from many car makers. All because Tesla dared to be the first EV to rise to the top of the EV market! Thanks Elon! the Teslas are great cars! IGNORE the anti EV gas trolls negative comments on Tesla cars, those oil car lovers and gas polluters who love sucking on gas fumes and want to spend a fortune repairing their obsolete oil cars every year. I would rather save THOUSANDS a year on maintenance costs and drive a low maintenance EV.....  time to stop giving money to rich greedy oil barons who waste their money on expensive gas guzzling lamborghinis.......SPECIAL NOTE TO ELON: Please improve your customer support, as I am sad to see the poor customer reviews on this site. Tesla Motors makes a great car, please match that with great service. Set the example for all the other EV makers. Be like Rolls Royce and give sterling customer service!!!Eric Webb",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,eric webb,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/64c01ecfca8792001212aefc/,Rating,5,1,5,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

My interactions with the service center over the past few years have been nothing short of a nightmare. On multiple occasions, when I entrusted my vehicle to their care for servicing, I received it back in a worse condition than when I initially handed it over. It is disheartening that a company of Tesla's stature cannot fulfill its commitment to providing reliable and effective service.One of the glaring issues I encountered was their blatant disregard for timelines and promises. Time and again, they made assurances they could not keep, leaving me frustrated and disillusioned. Their inability to adhere to deadlines not only inconvenienced me but also highlighted a lack of organizational competence.Moreover, the service center's understanding of technical issues and their subsequent resolution is questionable at best. It is alarming that a company at the forefront of technological innovation fails to address fundamental problems within their service operations. The repeated instances of returning my vehicle with more issues than initially reported indicate a systemic failure in their approach to quality assurance.Equally disappointing is the woefully poor customer service. Dealing with the Tesla Service Center in Ålesund has been the worst customer experience I have ever encountered. The lack of empathy, communication, and accountability from their staff exacerbates the frustration and disappointment customers feel when facing issues with their vehicles.In light of these experiences, I can no longer endorse Tesla as a reliable and customer-centric brand. I strongly caution prospective buyers to reconsider their plans to invest in a Tesla vehicle. The allure of cutting-edge technology should not overshadow the fundamental aspects of customer service and reliability that are sorely lacking in my experiences with the Tesla Service Center in Ålesund.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Endre,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/637b5b4340a5950013e41a34/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

I have a 2022 Model Y, which from my perspective drives like a sports car. It isn't a cushy ride, so it's not for everyone. The performance, however is great. This is my third electric car and by far the best, as the first two were what I would call ""first generation"" vehicles with around 100 miles of range, good for regional use only. This one is fantastic for road trips. I went from scrambling to find CHAdeMO chargers that were not broken and would accept my payment to the amazing ease of backing in, plugging in, and watching the volts scream in to the battery at rates I'd never seen before. No fussing with my phone or a payment method - it just starts and works exactly as anyone would wish. In California I can attest to plentiful, functioning and comfortable charging stops. The range at freeway speeds is not as good as the EPA number, but it is far better than my previous cars and is really all I want in the seat in one stint anyway, that is, about three hours. I also love the storage capacity of this car. There seems to be no end to the places I can stash things, and the main cargo area is huge. With the back seats folded down it perfectly holds a twin size mattress pad, which I've utilized twice to camp out at RV sites on a longer road trip. Get the plug adapters for the outlets used at RV sites and you can also get a ""free"" full charge overnight. Sweet! The service has been great, although I haven't had major issues to really test that. Firstly, when I bought it, one of the wheel covers disappeared during a drive. They came to the house and replaced it for free. Then I called about tire rotation. They came to the house and did it in the driveway. Amazing! (And I have a narrow, cramped driveway.) Oil changes and tune ups? Yeah - good riddance to those. And with the car leveraging the generator more than the brakes to slow it down, even the brake pads seem unlikely to need service. What's left? Apparently only tires and washer fluid. My only gripes would be the occasional discomfort of the ride and the fact that the wheels are wider than the tires. Take a glance at most Teslas' wheels on the curb side and you'll see the ugly mess that results from aluminum upon concrete. Apart from that, though, this is by far the best car I've owned (at 63), and my experience with Tesla has been great.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,William,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/59753f2e0000ff000ab2c100/,Rating,5,1,5,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

I am writing to express my extreme concern and disappointment regarding a serious malfunction I experienced with my Tesla vehicle, Model Y, on 08/01/2023. The incident has left me deeply troubled and has raised significant questions about the safety and reliability of your vehicles.On the aforementioned date, while I was driving my Model Y, I noticed an unusual burning smell coming from the vehicle. Shortly after, the cruise control system began to malfunction erratically, leading to a loss of control over the vehicle's speed. In a matter of seconds, the display and all lights on the dashboard went dark, leaving me unable to monitor crucial information such as speed, battery level, and vehicle warnings.Worse yet, the electronic power steering suddenly failed, causing an immediate stiffening of the steering wheel and making it incredibly difficult to control the vehicle. As a result, my car veered into a curb, causing damage to the wheels and suspension and fire.I cannot stress enough how distressing this situation was. Not only did it put my safety and the safety of others at risk, but it also raises questions about the reliability and effectiveness of the various systems within the vehicle. I have always trusted Tesla's commitment to innovation and cutting-edge technology, but this incident has shattered my confidence in the vehicle's reliability.I am writing to urge you to take immediate action to investigate this malfunction thoroughly and provide a comprehensive explanation for what transpired. I request a detailed analysis of the root cause of the issue and assurance that appropriate measures will be taken to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.I have been a loyal Tesla customer for 2 years and until this incident, I have been delighted with the exceptional performance and features of your vehicles. However, this incident has left me deeply concerned, and I sincerely hope that Tesla takes my complaint seriously and addresses it promptly.I kindly request that you arrange for a thorough inspection and repair of my vehicle to ensure that it is safe to drive. Additionally, I would appreciate timely updates on the investigation and steps being taken to prevent similar occurrences in other Tesla vehicles.Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that Tesla will uphold its reputation for excellence and take the necessary actions to rectify this situation and ensure the safety of its valued customers.Sincerely,sabih saleem",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Sabih Saleem,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/64cc87f59dc4370012b16bc6/,Rating,5,1,2,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

From the moment I set foot in the showroom, I was met with a level of service and innovation that exceeded my expectations.The initial step of configuring my Model 3 online was a breeze. Tesla's user-friendly interface allowed me to tailor every aspect of my car to my preferences, from color to interior finishes and even performance features. This customization made me feel like I was truly getting a unique vehicle that matched my personality and needs.The in-person experience at the Tesla showroom was equally impressive. The staff was incredibly knowledgeable about the product, providing detailed insights into the Model 3's performance capabilities, safety features, and the technology integrated into the car. They patiently answered all of my questions, making the entire process informative and enjoyable.The test drive was a highlight of the experience. Feeling the Model 3's instant acceleration, responsive handling, and the regenerative braking system left me in awe. It's not just a car; it's an exhilarating driving experience.When it came to the purchase, Tesla's transparency in pricing was refreshing. There were no hidden fees or surprises, and the absence of haggling was a welcome departure from the traditional car-buying process. The online ordering and payment system were straightforward and efficient.Delivery day was another standout moment. The Tesla team ensured that my Model 3 was impeccably clean and ready for its new home. They took the time to walk me through the car's features, making sure I felt confident in operating the vehicle and understanding the full scope of its capabilities.The Model 3 itself has been a revelation. The electric range, performance, and technology integration are unparalleled. The instant torque and quiet operation are addictive, and the Autopilot features have made long journeys a breeze. Charging the car at home or on the Supercharger network is convenient, and I've saved significantly on fuel costs.Overall, my experience with Tesla and the Model 3 has been a transformative journey. It's not just a car; it's a symbol of cutting-edge technology, sustainability, and innovation. Tesla's commitment to the electric vehicle revolution, combined with their dedication to customer service, has made me a loyal advocate. I can confidently say that my Model 3 purchase was an amazing and rewarding decision, and I look forward to a future filled with sustainable and thrilling driving experiences.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Michael Woodard,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/653a64844ed50500118fd09f/,Rating,5,1,5,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

It's a company car through my own business and was a no brainer on cost with tax savings etc. The purchase was amazing. Super smooth, rapid availability, very helpful. We had planned to get two more as company cars when the other directors' current leases expire. The car itself is really lovely to drive, fast, smooth. A delight. That's the 2 in the 2/10.But - the after care experience is beyond appalling and would definitely stop me choosing Tesla again.The car is delivered on a trailer with less than 50 miles charge. There's no handover briefing so you and Google have to work together on everything to find out how to do the most basic of functions like using the wipers. I get the advanced stuff being researchable, but really, not being able to turn the wipers on?!It's Tesla so I assumed it would be super-intuitive and anything I did research would be easy to follow and superbly done. It's not. Info is difficult to find, user experience on guides etc a 1/10.The charging station installed at the office was a farce. Advice we had from Tesla was appalling. Hours on the phone, paying for two electrician visits and finally a simple solution was there all along when we reached someone with UK knowledge.The voice commands are comical - nothing works. That means you have to use the screen for everything and that doesn't feel safe. I use Siri before the Tesla voice options.Last straw? I've just clipped the rear tyre - and I mean clipped. It's immediately flat. It's ok, that's my fault. I call the AA and they tell me there's not much point coming out as they can't do anything with a Tesla. I call Tesla support (always ages waiting on the phone). I can't get it sorted from the office. It has to go off on a Transporter to the Tesla centre 15 miles away. Not very eco!

My Tesla is not a premium vehicle, it comes with laughable customer service who plainly do not care or are not empowered to care. The facilities are my local Tesla gargage are dirty, smelly and fall far short of almost any other garage I have been in this certury, the grounds around it are a mess also. I have rejected my car twice now, but even the finance company is ignored by them.

You don't get to deal with a human but an Algorithm. You can't speak to your local branch as they don't have a phone number and everything is routed through their Call Centre in Maidenhead. You can request to get a call from your local centre but I tried 8 times and never did anyone call back.After you pay your deposit you have 48 hours to complete the deal and pay the money.Tesla give you the Bank details of where to pay the money (in our case over £42K) The bank flashes up that this could be a fraudulent account and is not recognised proceed in the understanding you could lose your money. It is because Citi Bank isn't recognised in the UK.Trying to get basic info was horrendous. I spoke to the salesperson in the showroom and asked what the BHP of the car was, they said ""what's BHP""We tried to get the registration number for the car to sort out insurance but we were told the car will be registered only on the day of collection so entering the Reg No into websites doesn't work.Tesla seem to have a thing going with Directline insurance. You can't collect your car without insurance but they won't register the car with DVLA unless you provide Insurance. Catch 22. Directline insurance was £700 more expensive than my current insurer.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,John Hamill,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/59131cec0000ff000a96990a/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

His service was fantastic, absolutely second to none! I have been looking for new car so have been to many car showrooms over the last few weeks my experience with Connor knocked the other sales advisors for 6. Honest, friendly and patient, I felt Connor had one mission and that was to help, guide and support me when looking at the Tesla Model Y. His enthusiasm for the brand was real and made me truly excited to get on board. What an introduction to Tesla. Thank you Connor May, appreciate your wisdom and help this morning.

On Wednesday, April 26, 2023 I received an email confirming the offer. On Friday, April 28, 2023 I received an email stating that my order has shipped. This email included both the order number and the UPS tracking number. Also on Friday, April 28, 2023, I sent an email to the order department asking for the date that I would receive my order, because contrary to the email, UPS via the tracking number merely indicated that a label has been created. The automated reply to that inquiry stated that they would reply within 5 business days. However, as of today, I have not received a reply from the order department, and furthermore, UPS still indicates that only a label has been created and no shipping has occurred. Tesla has no phone number, and I spoke with the local dealer here in Chicago, who said that he would look into the issue, i.e., check order status, check their inventory to see if they could supply me with one, and contact the service center to see if they have one; and he would get back to me this afternoon. Of course, unfortunately, I did not hear from him. So I just purchased a $43,000 electric car from Tesla, the car doesn’t come come with a charger, I have to pay for it myself, but after ordering it and paying for it there has been no action and no way to communicate with them fir the purposes of getting information or resolving the issue",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Brad,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5e0324146af50222f22b748f/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

Fun Vehicle of Mediocre design and quality.,"This company gives you a delivery range of two months, and when it comes time for the actual delivery, you are given a two day window to come and get it. This two-day window is really just a suggestion on Tesla's end. There is a better than average probability that your car will not be there on the date of your appointment. Expect same-day cancellation of the appointment from Tesla, which is just peachy when you have made arrangements with work, ride, etc. to be able to be there. Also don't believe the stated ability to deliver to your home if it is within 220 miles. There are a lot of conditions that would have to be met to make that true. And if you can't come get your car, they will cancel the sale, keep your deposit as a penalty and give the car to someone else. Even though you already have an insurance policy on it. It is a one-way contract, where the customer has no rights and the company has no accountability. The car is fun to drive, of mediocre build quality and has the advantage of the best national charging network. They have dumbed down the definition of SUV to mean a low-clearance vehicle with a little extra cargo room. They should just call it a utility vehicle. Obviously no one at Tesla has ever left the pavement or the city for that matter. If it wasn't for the charging network, there are better choices than Tesla. It will be interesting to see how they fare when there is a competitive marketplace. Will they begin to treat their customers with consideration or continue with the ""Heads I win, Tails you Lose"" that defines their current business model.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Eric Henrickson,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/6452ea70c959a500128e0cce/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

With the inability to change the size of the fonts (as every phone can do now) this makes for an extremely stressful and dangerous drive.The build quality of shocking too, for a £60,000 car less than 6 months old the plastic was creaking, the road noise was appalling.The dealership staff quite simply could care less and clearly implied that I was just the wrong customer for them, like it was my fault!!Absolute rubbish.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Mark,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/6446647e04afe70012f0e81e/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

Whatever you have read about the awful service, it is probably an understatement. Bought and paid for my car in full weeks ago. I still cannot agree a proper defined UK collection date. My on-line account said the car was ready for collection just an hour or so before the defined collection time, so it was wholly impossible to drive across London at a moments notice. Further, I have still not been told the registration number of the car so I cannot insure it anyway. No one at Tesla returns calls, nor do they respond to emails, including those copied to one of their UK directors. I now have ten messages and emails with zero reply.

I sure hope that a Tesla rep with influence reads these reviews. They depict the truth. I have a doctoral degree in Electronics, Automation, and Robotics so when I get service done I want to know what and why. So far I’ve put $5500 in repairs into my “new to me” 2015 Model S P85D - 80,000 miles.  Granted I upgraded the computer and carbon fiber. I have unlimited supercharging and lifetime premium connectivity. I’ve been into service many times in the year and a half I’ve owned the car. I spent $3000 on a new BMS component after the car shut down and then it shut down on the way home. Apparently there were more problems causing the same alarm. I was told water got into something. I tested the replaced component and I found nothing wrong with it. A few more minor issues plus a 12v battery replacement. Then all new power relays. Also, I’ve been living with a charge port closed switch failure. After a normal day of great driving, I return to the car in the morning (in my garage) and the 12v system is down and I can’t start car. I jumped the 12v and the car came to life so I could put it in tow mode and spend another $400 to tow it to Tesla. I’m told I need a new 90kW battery for $15000. I had no distant issue or power loss. I could get 0-60 in 2.5 seconds and I charged it to 80% nightly. Range around 230 miles. There is no way the battery is bad.  I asked what was wrong with it and just like every other question, No reply. I even had a technician incorrectly tell me how a relay worked. I didn’t argue but did disagree. He came running out after me and said he called his dad and his dad told him I was right. So Tesla service is too inadequate for the vehicles. I will replace my unicorn’s battery (a flawless looking, lifetime free charging, lifetime free connectivity car) and sell it. I’m done with service that doesn’t make sense. I’m very easy to get along with yet very intelligent. Do not fix a problem by throwing possible solutions at it. I was going to buy another Tesla for the wife. I don’t thing that will happen and my colleagues at work are now shying away from Tesla. I used to talk them up and convinced two friends to purchase them.

Tried to delay collection just 3 days and they're not interested. Even reallocated my car to someone else 2 days before what was to be my collection day. I'm absolutely furious about this ridiculous system and due to estimated dates going forward it now looks like I'll be on holiday cruising Alaska when my next collection week is offered, although due to estimated and actual dates being unrelated I am still unable to plan another collection in what will be 2 more months. Tesla no longer seem to care about their customer relations and if I could buy this car in another way from somewhere else I would.

I've heard it's also used in certain social circles that I've seen programmes about on TV, but of which I haven't had any personal experience. Well, that was until I bought a Model Y, which I finally picked up last week.Let's get one thing clear straight away. I've bought an EV for tax purposes. That's it. Several years ago I bought Priuses, but after someone tapped on my window one day and asked me if I could take them somewhere, and another occasion when I was parked on the side of the road answering some texts and my rear passenger door opened and a mother and her daughter started to get in, I decided to go back to SUVs - of the gas-guzzling type. But recently, I've decided to dip my toes again into the environmentally (ignore the devastating consequences of mining) friendly waters of the EV scene. I see so many Teslas around the streets, there must be something good about them, I thought. And the tax breaks are still pretty good. And they're the longest range and best value of EV SUVs. They're not really SUVs, as the IRS has recently said, and I have to agree with them. I can get my big dog comfortably in the back of any of my previous SUVs, but there's no way he'd fit in this thing. But let's get onto the buying and handover experience. First of all, the website wouldn't take a credit card payment, so I had to drive miles (in my gas-guzzling SUV) to a Tesla store, where the assistant did some website workaround (because the website doesn't work properly) in order to take my deposit. And then I waited. With weeks to go, I was contacted by the finance company and did all the paperwork. All good so far. Tesla then bombarded me with multiple emails and texts asking me to complete financial paperwork, which I'd already done. And then with days to go until the handover, Tesla sent me a text asking me to make the initial payment through the website. So I went to the website, and ...My car had gone. They'd cancelled my order. Nothing there. Just an invitation to choose which Tesla I wanted to buy. Now, this was in the evening, and you'd think that as a global tech company, they'd have global 24/7 service. Oh no. It's 9-5, Monday to Friday in your own country. I mean, seriously?But we sorted that out (during office hours - with the finance company, not with Tesla), and I had a collection date and time. I was all excited. I love it when you go to pick up a new vehicle and the salesperson who's been looking after you through the process takes you around your beautiful new machine, which might have cost you over a hundred thousand whatevers. You know how the experience is when you unwrap a new electronic device that's designed in California but built in China and whose name I'd better not mention here in case it gets deleted? Well, I expected the same with my brand new Tesla Y long-range. The Tesla showroom at my pick-up location is a container in a car parking lot. There were three standing tables, with assistants standing behind each one, and a small table with some gross Tesla branded merchandise, including a creepy-looking soiled Tesla decanter. I mean, who on earth in a car company that goes on so much about safety thought that a branded container for alcohol would be a good idea for merch? If you haven't seen one, Google it. They really do exist.And now let me describe to you my handover experience. I was excited. After giving me the black Tesla cards, the sales assistant started the handover. She pointed to the parking lot and said, ""That's yours over there."" That was it.I'm not tech slouch. I've founded and built a tech startup before. I'm OK with tech. But it was a full 30 minutes before I could figure out how to make this thing move, and find the switch to turn off the hazard lights. But once I got it going, it was actually quite fun to drive.But it came with only 44% charge, which went down to 28% after driving only 15 miles. OK, I thought, the battery needs to be ""woken up"" a bit. So I went to try to charge it. I tried six different charging points, but it wouldn't charge in any of them. I spend around 36 hours over this weekend just gone trying to figure out how to charge the thing. Eventually I came across an article talking about rebooting. So I thought I'd give that a go. I rebooted my car. Who'd have thought that would be a thing. But it seemed like a cool, ""techy"" idea, so I rebooted it, and it worked. So my brand new car, with 15 miles on the clock is now re-charging. And it's gone from 26% to 71% in just under a day. Yep, 20 hours. Not looking good so far, which brings me back to the master-slave analogy. I can't help but feel like I'm the slave here, and my master in California or Texas or wherever is having a laugh at my expense while I have shiny white Model Y lodged up my fundament, glacially charging.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Nigel Kellow,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/58b807800000ff000a7d2901/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

I had done my research, test drove a vehicle, watched a number of video tutorials - I was ready to go! I went to the Chesterfield MO dealership and signed the papers. Everything seemed fine as I was driving down the interstate. However, as I got near Busch Stadium, the car just started to decelerate. Some weird things showed up on the dashboard about the emergency brake being deactivated and I’m just trying to hit the gas and it is not moving. I ended up in the fast lane on the middle of the Poplar Street bridge with a car that wouldn’t move!I was panicking and tried to call the Tesla dealership to ask what I needed to do. I ended up getting the phone directory nightmare and pressed the number for service. It informed me I needed to go to service through my Tesla app only. I called back and asked to go through sales. It would ring and no one picked up. I called 911 as I am hearing cars slamming on their brakes around me to avoid hitting me on the middle of the bridge! 911 dispatched an emergency vehicle and they towed/dragged my new car off of the bridge and parked it on the median at East St.Louis (the tow guys were FANTASTIC). I finally got through to Tesla and they just said I needed to tow it back to the dealership and they could look at it on Monday since the service department was closed over the weekend. I explained again that it was a BRAND NEW VEHICLE JUST OFF THE TRUCK - what on earth was going on? I told them I could have been killed on the Poplar Street bridge. There didn’t seem to be much concern, he just told me to have them tow it. I said “I can’t even get it started - it won’t go out of park.” No help again. I finally contacted Tesla support (text only, by the way) through the app to get emergency tow service. They sent me a link so I could reset the dashboard. It didn’t work. Then I was informed there will be a two hour wait for the tow to come. All via text - no person talking to me. The emergency roadside assistance gentleman said I should get a friend to pick me up and bring me back out to the Tesla dealership. When I got to the Chesterfield MO Tesla dealership, they seemed very casual about it. I told him I had been trying to reach the dealership to figure out about the tow and whether I should come back to the dealership myself and no one answered my call.  He informed me, “Well, we had a lot of people in here about 20 minutes ago. We just couldn’t pick up the phone - it should have gone to the National line. I’m really sorry”.

I do apologize about the length of this reviewI had a delivery date of a MY on Feb 6th-one day prior I got a text saying the car would not be there then and moved the date till Feb 13th…OK there could have been logistics issues since it was a Fremont build…I get it.On the 11th I go to the Tysons Location to get the car. I was told once I went in the red door around the side go inspect your car and if you like it accept it and drive away. I did inspect it and everything seemed fine except I noticed some issues with the paint that appeared to be under the clear coat.I got a representative to come out and take pictures-It just so happened she was also in charge of the paint shop and made a ticket for me and said it would take 2-5 days. I left the car asked for Tesla to get an Uber as my wife came with me but had other commitments in Tysons. The representative said she would be in touch with me throughout the week to let me know how the repairs were going and possibly they might get the car fixed before 5 days.Yesterday I finally did get a VM from the Tesla representative that they did not have the issues straightened out and they were going to push the delivery date out. I looked in the app and it is now Feb 25th….Come on they can build one of these cars in like 1min.I am fairly certain what happened was they did nothing and saw me on the delivery schedule for the next day and actually started to get these issues in motion to be fixed. The Tesla rep did not contact me during the week and only did the day before delivery.This review was earned and with this experience I would advise to pick up at a different location. Their QC at the Tysons location did not initially catch the very apparent paint issues and their response has been far from acceptable.  Bad reviews are usually earned and they earned what is the lowest possible rating with behavior like this.,,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Jim Payne,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/63f236a5264a800012fd2ad7/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

I was so proud and excited to purchase a pre own 2018 Tesla model S without thinking and doing research carefully . I’ve experienced issues such as door handle (the most common one), brake pad, screen,  upgrades…I got a used one(34k miles) for 70k (way overpriced) and have driven for about 700 miles, door handle got stuck and it painfully cost me $425 to fix(my basic warranty expired). The major issue started when I reversed it and it made an incredible loud bang sound like metal slammed to metal, it was shocking. I immediately scheduled service appointment and they stated if they were going to take a look there would be a diagnose fee of couple hundred dollars therefore they only drove it and said my brake was absolutely normal, then it happened again, I brought it in for another service and again they confirmed nothing was wrong with my car. On 1/30/23, my Tesla was completely stuck, I couldn’t move forward or backward, something wrong with the drive unit/motor and it strongly stopped my car from moving, the tow company wanted $300 to tow it to the service center, I didn’t want to pay that much and I tried put more pressure on the accelerator to try to move it, my car was forcefully bouncing forth and back for 35 seconds and boom, that metal collapsed sound happened again I even had my son recorded to show them proof because they had never believed my story, I got blamed and excuses for all of the issues. The total of 5 unbelievable visits to SC for driving less than 1k miles. I treat this tesla like a baby, garage kept, haven’t drove in the rain, drive it very gently and routinely charge it. Anyway, I had to agree to the diagnose fee in order for them to open things up to take a glance . Finally they found something wrong with the brake and painfully charged me $800 but not guaranteed if that abnormal sound or car being stuck would happen again and I don’t know when it would act up (safety concerns). I had explained to them multiple times regarding the issues with the recorded video clip for proof and I still got blamed for not using my Tesla properly, they suggested me not to  let my car sit there for extended period of time (I haven’t done that, it’s been driven daily and they also blamed on the phenomenal issue, specifically occurred to my Tesla only. After reading all negative reviews, I strongly believed these reviews are true and honest. I have purchased many different brand cars and not a single/simple problem occurred whatsoever and even the old one with 200k miles wouldn’t hurt me badly like this Tesla S. I feel so regret that I couldn’t sell it because the price significantly dropped, hurting many tesla owners, some dealers already stopped buying or taking Tesla for a trade in, some offered me dirt cheap low for my Tesla model S, I’m now stuck with this poor quality car with constant issues and unpredictable ones unexpectedly coming anytime. It is a nightmare, a disease, a stress because it hurts me both mentally and financially. Tesla really need to do something seriously about all those complaints and concerns. Please treat consumers right, stop taking advantage of consumers, playing around with people trust and please stop taking  people hard work money. You guys need to lower the repair/maintenance/ ripped off fees or do something fairly for many bad luck buyers like me……never buy anything from Tesla again.

Starting with me being unable to purchase a wall charger online and having to drive to their Leeds store to pick one up. Then only having 100 miles charge on the car which meant I had to charge it immediately and incur cost. Then the slow implementation of my free charging which meant several charges before that. finally and worst experience of all has been after i received a puncture on Sunday 22nd January. I was 40 miles from home, they could not tow me to a garage that fit a new tyre on the day. Therefore i needed to get home and then get my car to a tyre fitter the next day. Tesla would only provide one tow. This meant that although I was not at fault i would be liable to get my car to a preferred provider which would have been very expensive. Luckily the AA saved me by getting me home that night with my car. This meant that Tesla (supposedly) could still provide a tow for me to my loal tyre fitter. This was booked for Thursday 26th. they did not show. i had several conversations with Tesla handlers chasing the towing firm. To no avail.

You can search the knowledge base but there is no way to get support or even speak to anyone apart from  raise a return to service centre request (I.e. tough luck).Oh and the week after we purchased for £49k they started giving away 1000's of miles of charging (which would have helped us get from Bristol to Cornwall to deliver the car to our home!).  The following couple of weeks after that they reduced the value of the car to £42k - so we are stuck with a £49k finance on a  £42k car - so £7,000 of our hard earned money(finance) to light Elons bitcoin cigar.Not my favourite company right now, and with many years of finance remaining I am sure we will never ever do this again.

We now need to change my wife’s BMW X4 so I thought Tesla as we have live in a new Ultra modern self build house with 34 industrial size panels in our paddock. At the moment we are generating 12kWh and both our batteries are already fully charged so why not ?Unfortunately I have found it impossible to talk to Tesla’s UK call centre, it’s also impossible to talk to our local dealer in Bournemouth. We live about an hour’s drive from them so we need to know which cars, if any, they have in their Bournemouth store before making the 2 hour round trip. I have called several times over the last week and even took up the offer of a call back, which, after a painfully long wait, I gave up on. I just couldn’t wait any longer. Later that evening we did have a missed call from Tesla’s call centre, but it was obviously too much trouble for whoever bothered to call to leave a message. I mistakenly thought that someone would call back the next day as you do, but nothing  !Tried calling again today, before leaving for the Bournemouth store but gave up after listening to some rather annoying music for over half an hour and thinking that hopefully Tesla might do me a favour and just answer and sell me a car. I am obviously no different from the rest of you guys that have left feedback on this site, why I thought I was, was just wishful thinking on my part. I thought I would call our local BMW dealer in Yeovil to see how they fared and have just spoken with them regarding a new IX and I4, this took about 40 seconds including pushing the buttons on my phone. How would you go about solving a problem with a Tesla when you can’t even talk to someone when you want to buy one ?In my experience the sales people in any BMW, Mercedes or Audi dealership pickup within seconds of dialling but not Tesla UK.Anyway, it’s looking like my wife’s getting a new BMW and  hopefully I won’t have to wait as long as trying to talk to Tesla call centre for their share price to recover so that I can sell up and get out.

I have a Tesla Model 3, rear wheel drive and have had recurring problems with the upper control arm assembly and steering links. You don’t have to search hard on the internet to see that this is a product design or manufacturing defect that is being experienced by hundreds of owners. I have now replaced those parts twice on a 2018 vehicle, at $1,500 cost for each replacement. The time between replacement this last time was only 18 months. And they say not covered by warranty because of the mileage. But these are not parts that should wear out every 30,000 highway miles!  I have loved the driving experience but I’m getting ready to replace my car with another EV and sadly it won’t be with another Tesla.  Now there are so many options.

As on previous encounters there was only one person at the reception area desk.   I was informed car was ready and key was in car. I had to ask where the car was located ""slot number 9"".  Had to ask where that was ""the end of this building"".  I had to ask what the problem was with the traction control.  Was told everything checked out no problems with the wiring or software. Told they thought it was the passenger rear tire which did not match the other tires,  they exchanged it.  I told them and so they should since that tire was placed by their shop.  ( I had a nail in the cars original tire, so Tesla replaced it with a Michelin tire--the rest of the tires are Pirelli). Service person indicated that this tire was not placed by them.  I had to inform her that indeed it was and gave her the timeline of that replacement.  After checking her computer she finally acquiesced that was correct. Before I left the service center I looked to make sure that the replacement tire was a Pirelli and the size matched the other rear tire.   The following day I checked the tire pressures and found the replaced tire had 47 psi where the other 3 had 39, 40, and 41 psi.  Why would you have one tire that was so much more inflated.  Of note when the original tire that had the nail was exchanged the tire pressure on the exchange was also 47psi.Owners Manual and screen display indicate tire pressure should be 42 psi front and rear.

It is a great car. But if you are considering buying a Tesla I strongly urge you DONT DO IT. I say this because Tesla service is possibly the worst I have ever experienced. The computer in my car was going out and to fix it Tesla gave me the option of installing a refurbished original system for $750 or a hot new infotainment upgrade for $2000. i went with the upgrade and when I picked up my car was shocked to find the new system did not come with AM/FM radio or Siriux XM satellite radio. Those are the two primary sources of music for me and what car audio system doesn't have them? They took these offerings away but will provide them for a ""software upgrade"" costing $500. I tried to reason with Tesla and said I would have gone with the cheaper solution had I known getting AM/FM radio (I like to listen to sports talk) or Sirius XM would cast an extra $500. But they said that a technician sent me a link over the Tesla service app that listed all the ""features and benefits"". I told them that taking something away is neither a feature or a benefit. I was sold on an ""upgrade"" that would fix all my car's problems and taking away my primary music sources is NOT an upgrade. Who follows a link and goes to read fine print about an upgrade to make sure things like major music sources aren't being taken away? It's like reading fine print to make sure you navigation system or brakes are still there. It's supposed to be an UPGRADE! They did not see it my way of course and that is a simple illustration of how little Tesla really cares about their service. Another major problem with Tesla service is that it is impossible to talk to a live human being. They force everything to be done through their app. Whenever I have needed service my appointments have been pushed back time and again. This last time one of my car's problems was that the wifi system was failing so they couldn't pull diagnostics from it remotely. I tried calling them to tell them about my problems but all phone calls circle right back to sending you to their app. I don't have problems with technology, but sometimes it is infuriating and it almost always is with Tesla.

I paid $250 as a down payment. On 13th October 2022 I get a message on Tesla site that my car will be ready with a vin number soon for delivery. I had to leave out of the country due to emergency in my family so I called the Tesla dealership where I was to pick up the car and they told me that since I could not pick up I would be placed back on waitlist  and I would get my delivery date not sooner then a month. Since I was to return by then I placed my car on hold for my next turn when the vin number was assigned to me on 17 th October 2022. To my surprise the same vin number was given to me on 27 th October 2022 again. Since it was the same vin number I wrote an email to Ms. Katie Crabb, one of Tesla online sales person in charge of my order, that I had requested to go back in waitlist line as I could not pick up the car with the same vin number that was sent to me on 17 October 2022 as I was out of the country due to emergency. Please advise as to why I am asked to pick up the car with the same vin number. She replied saying this is the vin given to you to pick up your car on 27 October 2022. She never explained that this was the second vin number and final one and if I don’t pick up then my order will be cancelled! I sent a couple of email to Ms. Katie Crabb asking her again and again that since it’s the same vin number was it for the first order, but no reply from her. What lousy customer service for a senior citizen like me. I finally was told my order was cancelled and they will neither refund me $250 nor use the same downpayment to book again!I email to her supervisor Mr. W. Secor from Tesla explaining the same but no reply since 25 days from him either. I send several reminders too to answer to my email yet no reply from the supervisor Mr. W Secor. I was really surprised and upset that a company like Tesla has no time or makes no effort to connect with their customers. All Tesla is interested is to collect as many down payments they can get to cancel orders. I was given wrong information by Tesla that it would atleast be a month before my next vin number was assigned but I was never assigned another vin number but the first vin that I had asked to hold and put me at the back of the line as waitlist. We senior citizen are not used to buying cars on line so it’s all new to us and Tesla is very tricky to make us believe that the first vin number will be different from the second vin number and that the second vin number would be allotted after atleast 3-4 weeks and I was allotted the same vin number in 10 days. Please be careful as Tesla is based on lies and no response from either the sales person allotted nor the mangers to help. It takes hours on the phone to reach customer Service. They are Fraud. Go use the dealership to buy cars but not Tesla. With this experience how can anyone trust Tesla as when we have problem with Tesla cars they will NOT be there to answer our questions.

So when you have a positive experience, it never seems to get published.  So here goes, my Tesla left me stranded 200 miles from home.  Needless to say, I was mighty upset.  Placed an emergency road service ticket on my Tesla app; tow truck arrived within the hour and was towed to Cherry Hill NJ, 60 miles away at no cost, and was provided a $100 Uber voucher instantly along with   a loaner car for the day.  Plus my Tesla was expedited and repaired next day which allowed me to continue my vacation.  If this doesn’t rate as stellar customer service, I can’t imagine what more they could have done!

We bought a 4 year service agreement with Tesla totaling $4000 when we bought our car in 2018, and in that agreement annual check ups were promised.  We had it serviced annually, in 2019 and 2020.  When we went to the 3rd appt in 2021 in Rocklin we were told that we only needed to come in every other year and that the service contract would never expire, and that we would be taken care of, and not to worry.  So here we are 2 years later, getting our car serviced and a $800+ bill that should be covered under the service contract.  We moved to Scottsdale and they tried calling Rocklin, I have tried calling Rocklin and got routed to some place where the guy is only taking ""notes"" he also shared that it is doubtful I will get any resolution.  There is no direct way to speak with anyone to hold them accountable and ""take care of us"" as we were promised.  There is also NO record of this appt that we were turned away from, therefore as far as Tesla is concerned is never happened and it almost feels like they are accusing us of making this story up!  From what we can tell Katie cancelled our appt on 8/3/21 and misunderstood our situation and caused all of this mess.  There is NO WAY my husband and I could or would run our small businesses this way.  Such a lack of responsibility and integrity.  Why would we have paid $4000 for a service agreement and only get 2 services out of it?  We got completely bamboozled by Tesla and they owe us the money they took for the service agreement, and/or the money we are having to pay to have our car serviced, plus the next service, as promised in our service agreement.  The gal (Katie) who turned us away that day 2 years ago needs much better training as it is costing us money that we have already spent!!  Tesla should have the integrity to speak with us directly and not hide behind a service agreement expiration date.  Furthermore they need to take responsibility for the employee, Katie, who they are paying to represent the company, and speaking on behalf of the company's policies and procedures.  Why would we not trust her and the advice she gave that day?  She was there working, wearing the Tesla T-shirt, speaking with authority.  They need to explain the bad information we got from her, and correct this situation.  This feels so disrespectful as an early Tesla buyer (before the crazy days with long delivery dates). We even bought a model Y recently and I now feel that was a mistake and now I want to get rid of both Teslas.  I like supporting business that maintain good values and treat their employees and customers well, and that has NEVER been my experience with Tesla.  My husband also bought his daughter a model S, and she unfortunately has also had countless issues with her car and dealing with the service center in Tucson.  Tesla just doesn't care, and I doubt I will ever hear from anyone.  As I told the agent over the phone, Tesla sucks, which made him angry.

I had setup an appt for today evening but did not receive any proper directions. I used GPS to land at the factory but finding the test drive center took me forever.    Neither the directions are not at all clear, nor the sign boards are big enough to be noticed2. After a bit of struggle I did make it to the Test Drive center. The staff was not at all welcoming me but were totally relucant to give me a tour of the car   They pointed me to the car for test drive but direction even to the car was completely ambiguous. I landed at the wrong car at first, had to go back and forth to the center, to finally find my test drive vehicle.3. The staff assumed I knew all the things, how to even unlock the car, how to start it.     Yet again I somehow got into the car, tried to figure out everything on my own, finally realizing that I needed a PIN to start the car, which was not provided.4.

After test drive I went in to discuss the price, etc and once again your rude staff snubbed me stating that I can buy everything onlineThe staff was totally busy on their phones, not sure if it was work related...and not at all friendlyI was expecting much more professional behavior but sadly to say today's experience was far from it.

Tesla's Fort Lauderdale retail/service location ignored our presence at their show room this past Monday. There were 4 Sales Advisors behind a desk to the left of the glass door to the showroom. All four were busy looking at pc and or iPad screens, and none of them acknowledged our presence for about 5 to 7 minutes of us standing about eight feet from them. Then, one whose name we will not motion here, who in the end was polite, asked what he could do for us. We explained that when we got delivery of our second Model S we were not given the second key-fob standardly provided on delivery at that time to any Model S new owner. We explained that we had called Customer service and that a representative said that a note would be placed on our account allowing the service to provide the free key-fob. As he could not find the note, he said that he would text that person internally to confirm. Upon leaving the dealership, as asked by that Sales Advisor, we called Customer Service back and spoke with a person who happened to have the same name as the one we had spoken to that morning. She saw no notes on the account but assured us she would not only type them in but contact via text that Advisor we had just spoken with. Well, last night I received a message, from that Advisor, in which he said they would not do that ""because he could not see any authorization on that and that his Management did not want to provide the replacement key fob for free as the ""too much time had passed since we purchased the Model S"". Principal: We have been a long-time loyal Tesla owner since 2016, with the plans to exchange our owned Model S for a Plaid Model in the first QT of 2023. The extremely poor and unthought-out decision by the Fort Lauderdale Manager, as we were told, is so unfortunate! It is not business oriented at all that a Tesla Dealership Manager would not provide his customer with a free key fob which at cost for Tesla would represent less than 0.04% of the price of the car we intend to buy! Well, the price that they would charge of $217.75 is not the question here, but what does matters is the fact is that we were not provided with the second fob at delivery of our brand-new Tesla Model S at that time, therefore we should not be incurring in this expense at all. It is a question of principle, not money! For a long time, we have been noticing that Tesla is declining their customer service as originally experienced by us in 2016. It was awesome until we believe 2018! Since them we waited at times almost one hour on the phone to get a representative over the phone, and we were treated with disrespect at least two times at the North Lauderdale Service/Retail branch. At a time in which serious competition, not too much for the model S, is knocking on Tesla's doors day by day louder and louder it does become crucially important that Tesla pays attention and moves their service to one of the utmost Excellence. We would like the Management at Fort Lauderdale to be aware of what they are doing in terms of customer service, both on the retail and on the service side. On our last visit the speakers were blasting with rock music, so loud that the service representative behind the counter needed to scream at him so that we could understand him and vice versa. The service center looked disorganized and very confusing! On top of that we were ignored also by one of the persons on the second roll of counters, which was a female. She never acknowledged our presence as well. This is unacceptable! We would like to get this situation resolved and obtain the key fob which was never provided to us at delivery by the Dania Beach location (they were awesome to us on any encounter). Too bad that they are now closed!",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Sam Dias,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/6199732aace1180012d92cea/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

I Love my 2018 model S. Had a slight nocking noise from behind the dash while in warranty Aug this year. The first all day booking didn't sort it as they said they needed to escalate to 'engineering' to pinpoint remotely using a sound recording. The second booking did fix it by changing both front air suspensions and other bits but they left my steering wheel wonky when driving straight. To sort they say I need to rebook another service which I did but I insisted on a loan car which they agree to in the messages on the app. I got a message closer to the booking stating a strict contactless drop off. I reply wanting to confirming the loan car pickup to which they said they didn't have one available! I tried to resolve in messages within the app but they closed the booking saying I needed to start the process again. I now can't book anything in the App with Manchester Stockport as it just keeps saying 'try again' The App doesn't help diffuse frustration as the replies are generally rude, impersonal and provides no continuity with the ongoing issue. Being cut off mid problem is simply unacceptable. I feel they have now had 3 chances to fix my issue under warranty although they have fixed some and created another! Fed-up with the Tesla arrogance and not sure what to do with the car now. Its not the car - its the service quality and then the App that compounds any issues / complication.

This was lower than what Carmax offered and that says something!The dealership that purchased my vehicle at $18.2k, which was great. This did complicate the finance timing though and has left me in a tough spot. I have asked for an exception to their delivery time as I currently have no vehicle and a job interview in the morning tomorrow. After speaking with two people, neither was able to get the car processed one day early. One day, based on my unique circumstances. Net net of the situation; you can schedule to pick up your car tomorrow afternoon, Thurs or Fri. So, I have no car to get to my interview.

We had to drop everything to run up there last minute on Memorial Day or they said we would lose my place in line after waiting 14 months.  We just happened to look on the app the Thursday prior to the holiday weekend and it said to schedule our delivery.  This was our first and only notification.  Our only option for delivery was the following Monday, Tue or Wed....  So I delayed my trip to England, changed my tickets to go through ATL from our home in Florida and on Friday I worked out the financing of a 100k plus vehicle.  We had previously done the financing, but the original scheduled delivery of October 2021 had long passed and the financing expired.  In October, the delivery rolled to Nov, then in Nov to Dec etc.  This happened every month until Sept of 2022!  I landed on Monday, took the Metro to Decatur then an Uber to the dealer.  Bought the car, drove to ATL, parked it at ATL and continued to England.  Then when we returned, we had to fly through ATL and drive to Florida rather than direct to FL.  The inside of the windshield was so filthy on the drive home, when we turned into the sun, visibility was almost zero.  After we got it home, we could not add a key card.  The app said it was a known error that Tesla would have a fix for soon...  We tried to call but no answer.  I sent the Decatur rep, Roberto Perez an email because my fiancé couldn't use the car and it was her car.  He didn't reply.  I sent two more emails requesting a call.  Nothing...   Car sat in the driveway.  Finally I sent another email stating we are going to review this on every social media platform if we dont get a response.  Tried to call a dozen times, unable to get anyone.  Called Tesla and waited for 56 minutes on hold.  They sent a message to the location manager and promised a return call within an hour…. Lol yeah right.  Nothing.  So here is the complaint which I guess I will copy and paste on every platform I can find while I am again sitting on hold.  I strongly recommend waiting for Rivian or any other EV before purchasing a Tesla.  Decatur also forgot to sign the purchase agreement and have us sign it.  This, along with failing to send a picture of the window sticker, as instructed on the bank's draft check's instructions, caused the check to be canceled by the bank.  The best part is: still no contact from the manager at Decatur as promised numerous times?  How is he or she still employed by Tesla??

Expected delivery date June 2022. I get global supply chain issues and was okay with this. Never do you get any updates. Called in June and was told, ""Oh, since you haven't listed a payment method, delivery has been pushed back to September."" WHAT?! Got a notice that a VIN had been assigned to my order but told I have 24 hours to choose one of three days for delivery and those dates are less than a week away. I work as an ED doc. what if I had shifts those days? I can't just easily rearrange. What if I had been on vacation? I would have been put back on the waiting list. When I FINALLY reached a customer service rep, no help. Told me best to take delivery one of those three days. Dropping &gt;$60,000 on a car and I get treated like a teenager who wants the latest Hot Topic Gear. TESLA is basically treating it's customers like a commodity. Since there's high demand, they don't give a crap if the purchaser is dissatisfied. Add to this that now the cars no longer come with charging cables. don't get me wrong, they give you a credit to cover the cost of one but then that's a whole other step to get it. And, I entered the code, told by the website the code was accepted and I owed $0 then get a bill on my CC for the full cost. Now I have to dispute that. Hell, save us both some time and $$ and just give me the blood charger. Also come to find out, new Ys don't come with the homelink garage door opener installed. Bought an X 3 years ago and came standard. But now it's a $350 upgrade and I have to leave my car with them again. Why wasn't that listed as an option along with paint color, tow hitch etc?

I bought a Model S about three and a half years ago for nearly £95k, which compares to previous cars I’ve bought from Mercedes and Audi.Since then, I have been impressed by the capabilities and technology of the car, whilst at the same time irritated by the build quality and customer service.The latest issue has been with the windscreen washer pump, which has already been changed once about a year after I got the car. This in itself isn’t an issue to me; things go wrong its how they are dealt with that is the problem.I raised the service incident a few days after I noticed it had stopped working again, however it was about a week before a ranger could come out to fix it, again not an issue. The problem comes because I have gone over 50k mileage whilst waiting for it to be fixed, therefore making it not covered by the warranty. The ranger tried to fix the issue but failed, and I was asked to attend the Tesla Service Centre in Stratford upon Avon. I told them that I believed that the repair should be covered by the warranty and didn’t accept the quote for the work. When I took my car today I once again explain and told them I wasn’t happy, they said they would have a look into it. When they had finished, they told me they had fixed it and I needed to pay £135!!. This is for a pump which you can buy on the internet for about £5.To actually get my car back I had to pay this, no amount of complaining could change their stance.Insult to injury when I got my car back there was a tire pressure warning. I hadn’t even driven away! When I went back in, they told me it was already on when they got the car (this isn’t true and I asked them to check the car's logs to see this, which they declined). I said if it was on why didn’t they mention this, as a good customer service representative would! Their attitude was well tough!! I’m yet to see if there is any damage to the tire and if there is I will be pursuing it legally, just because their attitude stinks!I’ve owned several Mercedes, and there is no comparison!

It’s so bad that I would never buy another one. Paid over $120k for my model X and they can’t even treat you with basic customer service skills let along show appreciation for you as a customer. When I picked up my car for the first time four years ago, they towed away my trade in without letting me clean out my stuff! They couldn’t locate it until the next day and by then, thousands of dollars worth of designer sunglasses, jackets, car seats and items with sentimenal value was stolen. The last straw for me (and why I’m writing this review right now) is I brought in my car to the Burlingame, CA service center on a Thursday morning, expecting my car to be ready the same day, only to be told it wouldn’t be available until Saturday. I brought it in to fix recurring issues that they caused! One being I bought new tires that Tesla installed but the next day ended up with a flat tire on the side of the road. A tow, a visit from Tesla mobile, and a wasted Sunday afternoon later, the mobile tech said the screws weren’t tightened by the rep on my new tires which caused the leak and the flat tire. So back to Tesla I go. Second issue, I got the falcon wings seal replaced under warranty because it was cracked and went to get a car wash, and a puddle of water was sitting in my back seat. Back to Tesla I go! My passenger door window often squeaks as it rolls up and down, sometimes not going up or down with the auto-window function. Service center said all I need to do is clean the glass with glass cleaner to remedy the problem. WHAT?!? So another reason to go back to Tesla! All these problems were supposed to be resolved and my car ready on Saturday (3 days after initial drop off). Then I get a message on Saturday that said they would re-prioritize my car on Monday to work on it. So four days of my car sitting there without being worked on while I have a loaner car. Monday comes along and they say the car won’t be ready until Wednesday. Wednesday comes and now the car won’t be ready until Thursday. Great, except for the fact I’m leaving for a trip to Southern California on Thursday evening. Thursday late afternoon comes and I get a message saying my car won’t be ready until Friday!!! So basically I won’t have my car back for my road trip. At this point I’m stressed out and ask them to call me in the mobile app since there is no way to call the service center directly. No response. I explain I’m going on a road trip and am asking if I can take the loaner car with me. No response. Then they tell me the loaner agreement states I will be charged for miles over 200 miles and per day I keep the loaner after my car is ready. I text again to call me so we could talk through these charges AND I called the customer service line which was absolutely useless. I got no response from anyone. Finally spoke to the service center manager on Saturday (two days later), who was argumentative, condescending and unprofessional. He repeated he’s the highest level manager of the facility and he basically said I was liable for the loaner car fees, but if I had come in to see him in person, he would have waived the fees. When I asked why they didn’t honor my request to call me, he said they were too busy and it was end of day. They want to hold me to my rental agreement, but they don’t want to honor the service agreement that said my car should have been ready days before my trip. To end my story, Tesla kept my car over a week, didn’t communicate the issues with me, then charged me to use the loaner car, because they couldn’t get my car ready before my trip and wouldn’t work with me on a problem they caused.I’ve had multiple cars in the past and have never had such poor customer service, poor technicians and are treated like a second rate citizen all at the same time. I will never again purchase a Tesla. The car is great but it’s not worth this level of bullying and disrespect. Tesla has such a large share of the EV market, they feel like they can treat their customers like crap after purchase.

A month on and I have nothing to confirm against so have told them to forget whatever it is they think they may have started and I have began to source another vehicle with a trustworthy broker.Beware things at point of sale like being told they have matched a car, you then find on a month later that you will get a text when you have a match, one person saying 'your car is due in Nov', then the next saying but your car is 'going to be here in Dec', then you have to have to force a confession from them that until there is a match you will not be given a delivery date.Complaints have been registered with both parties.Total amateurs and best avoided.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Jason Moisey,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/63078572b2fce80012ab9c68/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

One of their customers who also had a model S said 'remember......it's a Tesla' After sales serviceYou can only go to Tesla for after sales who have a limited SC coverage and believe me they know it Don't count on getting anything done fast or to your satisfaction If you are used to good customer service and decide to buy a Tesla please manage your expectations and be prepared to enter a world of pain!As mentioned I can't wait to get the faults sorted with this vehicle and get rid of it ASAP!Anyone want a Tesla ?SO TO CONTINUEThe very next day after posting this review Tesla called me to advise that all parts were in and the job can be completed The guy asked me what they could do to help ease the situation as he had read all of the logs and could understand my frustrationIt is agreed that Tesla will collect my car on 07th Sept, leave a loaner, fix my car and bring it back to collect their loanerIm not holding my breath as I am fully expecting a note delaying the appointment on the 06th or a denial of the agreement (I couldn't make it up?)Lets seeModel X still for sale at some time in the future.....Conclusion....... The vehicle was collected.... a day earlyNot an issue as I was happy to get ridAfter a couple of days I was asked if it was OK to carry our a factory reset to clear all GPS locations and eradicate the weird raising and lowering issue.... I agreedThe SC contacted me asking when I would like to collect the vehicle..... I refused as the deal was that they would deliver it back to meThey did the next dayThe representative was informative by explaining what had been done to rectify all of my issuesThe cost would have been, if not under warranty, way over £2000.00So since I have owned the vehicle (a 2019) over £3000.00 worth of parts and labour have been allocated to itOn the first outing...... the suspension raised unexpectedly and I called the rep as the factory reset obviously did not resolve the issueFortunately there was a quick fix and I have now switched off the auto raise and lowerThe rep also advised me to drive always in the normal setting as anything else will cause wear to the inside or outside of the tyresNow I have a Tesla that works and for some freak reason my battery full charge capacity has increased from a max of 252 miles to 261???Looking at and testing alternative EV offers I can't find anything that delivers better range and software than the X that I have so will keep this vehicle until the warranty is up..... then its outThe issue with Tesla is the the build quality is not able to compete with its European rivals and due to a lack of spare parts and staff after sale support is appallingLets hope it all improves for Tesla in the future as I would not wish my experience upon ....... most people",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Rob H,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5176519b000064000138f727/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

During the past four years (covering both cars), I've needed to take the Model 3 in to a service center once and that was to get it's FSD computer upgraded. That appointment went without incident. Also, over the past 4 years, I've used Tesla mobile service 4 times to perform tire rotations, replace cabin air filters and twice to sanitize the AC condenser coils when they started to smell. The mobile service teams are great. It's easy to schedule service through the Tesla app (although it can sometimes take a week or more in my area to get an appointment). The service tech has always arrived within the promised window and satisfactorily completed the service. In my experience, both my cars have been quite reliable and just needed minor maintenance which is typically performed by Tesla mobile service in my driveway.

Person who set us up was great. They offered finance solutions through their finance partner Pepa money(EV Direct). it was great. We fill all forms required electronically with the tesla sales person. My wife and i applied for a joint load. Pepa approved the loan our delivery was due in april 22.  The. due to delay we were informed that delivery of the car will be delayed and new schedule is August to October 22. We were happy to wait and had no issues. Finally now all has come closer and Tesla is closer to delivery. But this is when all extremely poor service started. Tesla has no human touch at this point. They don't care and would like to demand and command the customer to things. my invoice was sent via the tesla account and it was one of those day that i was very busy on the road with my work. i rang and ask one of the team members if he could email it to me on PDF for so that i can send it to Pepa for payments. This gentle man said no worries and send it to me under W minutes. That was brilliant servide. However i did not notice that the invoice they send had only may name on it and my wife's names was missing. i send the invoice to pepa. Then after a week Pepa send me an email saying that both delivery address and invoice address is incorrect and to ask Tesla to correct it. I spoke with a team member and she said i will resend to your email again but it is correct. So i forward that to Pepa and again and told them Tesla mentioned that nothing is wrong with addresses, they are correct. Then i call Pepa and ask what is happening. Then they apologised and said sorry it is not the address it should have both you and your wife's name on invoice and on delivery address because have a joint loan. I rang again and ask Tesla to correct it. Then a team member said sure will update it on your app account soon.I had a look at the account after 6 hours and it was not updated. Then i rang them again and ask about it but they did not show any care for my request. They just said they don't happen like you ask they will take time. Then i ask due to this if my delivery get held up what will happen. Then they said we will hold it only for one week and we will give it to another customers. This is the time i realise how poor the service from these guys are. I have waited 6 Months and when the car is ready to be delivered this is what i am going through. Not only that, then i requested when it is updated to send it to my email account soon as they have it ready so that i can forward that to Pepa without having to go to a computer down load from the app and forward to pepa. This is where all the bad things happen. He said no we will not email you to give me hard time. then i receive and email saying due to security reasons they will not email any one on PDF form and only way to access is via the app. At this point Tesla has twiced email me the invoice on PDF version to my email account and i was able to send it to Pepa straight from my phone. So how comes if it is security breach, they did send that twice. This is not security breach from my view. Also i don't think this covers Australian law. Just imagine some one who has no skills to use computers but can drive and has money to by a tesla on a loan dealing with this. Are they going to discriminate them and say no you can not receive invoices via email or as a hard document? Not only this after all these battles i am still waiting for the correct invoice. Today is 13/8/22 and the invoice on my tesla app account is still with only my name and it has not been updated with my wife's name on it.

To my surprise, it came with 450 miles on the odometer, apparently someone purchased and returned it or they gave it to someone to drive.  Tesla ignored my written complaint about it. They didn't even bother to erase the prior driver's GPS info.  Then 2 months later, I received notice that for $2000, they will essentially unlock the vehicle's potential for greater acceleration.  Veh. came w/a 50K mile warranty, just before it expired, the climate control was faltering and it failed.  When we brought it to them (2 weeks after booking an appointment) with 50,750 miles.  Despite that there was a real question as to whether the a/c failed before the 50,000 miles, they stuck us with nearly a $4,000.00 bill for it.  Also they charged us an additional $750 for failed struts that they originally told us would be warrantied.  Their service department is also the very worst, they NEVER answer the telephone (this has happened over 5 times).  They apparently will not let you speak with a manager either.  If you want to schedule an appointment, you must do it, on line, several weeks in advance regardless of the problem with the car. I once asked, in 2020, the service manager why won't they answer their telephone? He told me that their carpet cleaner had damaged their phones (clearly not true).  Once they give you your car and take your money, they clearly don't want to hear from you or see you again.  I owned several luxury vehicles before I brought a Tesla and have never been treated so poorly.  Telsa does not back up its products (in light of the foregoing),  They are the vehicular equivalent of the ""Soup Nazi"" from the Steinfeld TV show.   It is unfortunate because their vehicles have real potential to be a great product.  Telsa's failure to back up its products and outrageously poor customer service destroys the value of its vehicles.  We may have saved on gas, but were ""screwed"" by Telsa's failure to back up its products (even after only two years post-purchase).  The outrageous and infuriatingly poor service was the final straw.  I will NEVER by another Tesla.

First, the door and hood panels didn't mesh properly, and we took it in for service in Rocklin, CA, in 2020.  They tried to fix it with a ball peen hammer, and left the hammer in the car!  We complained, and took the car in again.  Tesla sent us to a third party body shop under warranty to fix the misaligned doors and rear hatch.  Next, the rear hatch failed to open and close, and Tesla sent us to another body shop under warranty to get that fixed.  Then, we hit a pothole at night in Tahoe City, CA, in winter of '21, and got a pinch flat caused by the stock tire on our 20"" rims cutting a two inch gash in the sidewall.  No spare, of course, Tesla roadside service was useless, and we waited in the car at night from 7:30 to 11 p.m.  We paid to have the car towed to Sacramento Tesla, and had to hassle them to get a new tire (not in stock) after waiting several days.  Recently, a small plastic piece on the end of a bungee cord got caught in between the glass sunroof and glass hatch window when the window was up.  When I pressed the button to lower the rear hatch, the glass in the hatch shattered and the sunroof corner fractured.  $2,900 + dollars estimate by Tesla, who said they would only accept their insurance, not ours, we would have to pay up front, and they made an appointment to fix both sunroof and hatch glass.  Night before, they called and said the glass would not be in for another 8 days minimum.Does this sound like a reliable car and good service to you?  This will be our first and last Tesla.

There is no one you can call to ask a question about service. You have to do everything thru their app and it is not that easy to navigate. For instance if you need new tires, which other shops are hesitant to work on a Tesla, it is not easy to communicate that to the service department. I have scheduled and service and then they have just cancelled it without explanation. I have taken my car there with low tire pressure and they have messaged me it is done but I can’t tell if they fixed the tire. You don’t know if they are going to keep your car overnite as there is NO ONE who is going to talk to you or message you an estimate of how long the service will take. And then when the car is done, they leave it in the lot and try not to talk to you again by leaving the check out to the app. They sure save money on staffing but the customer service is absolutely non- existent.

Having purchased what is considered a premium product, one would expect any issue(s) which arose would be dealt with in a professinal manner by the manufacturer.   Teslas policies with regards to Customer Service seem designed to ensure that when there is an issue, the customer is the last party to give consideration to.   Their Customer Care commitment to ""providing the best possible experience"" as stated on their website seems like a mockery of the customer when you are the customer having to deal with them.For the purposes of this review I will only detail the vehicles present issue but there have been several others since its purchase in March 2021.  My Model 3 recently informed me via an on screen message and just as we were leaving for the airport, that the ""12volt battery needed to be replaced and that the car was shutting down.  Please contact Tesla to arrange a service""  What !!! on what is considered to be most advanced vehicle from a technology point of view, it couldn't be programmed to tell us the battery needed replacing before it decides to shut down??   Thankfully, we were at home and not several hundred miles away. However, that said, all vehicles have issues so I would forgive that issue and I contacted Tesla.  They retrieved the vehicle a couple days later, pulling the vehicle with locked wheels on to the flat bed truck, a direct contravention of how it should be done according to the Tesla manual.  According to Tesla Service on mentioning this-""yeah seen it done before - not an issue"" Why bother putting it in the manual then.I had asked for a car to replace my vehicle as the repair is a warranty issue. I was advised that a rental vehicle was hired for me some 30 miles away from my home and I could pick it up there.  No issue, send a taxi and I will go get it.   No, how I get there is not a Tesla concern.  I could not avail of the rental without losing a day from work and then would need to return the rental three days later (more lost time) and then undertake another journey to Tesla Ireland to pick up a loaner.  Tesla Ireland in Dublin is based 120 miles away.   Again, I could not avail of this without considerable time lost (two days between collection and drop back)  and considerable expense by way of trains and taxis.   These issues were not a concern for Tesla.  On this point of lost time and costs.   My annual savings over a combustion engine car are approximately €4000 euros.   To date, as self employed people, my wife and I have lost 4-6 days on returns (outside of the present issue) to the Tesla garage in Dublin.  Any savings on fuel are clearly lost at this stage and the loss of earnings considerable.  To others, like an employee who buys a Tesla as a private vehicle, days lost are either unpaid leave or holiday time lost. A high price to pay for Tesla ownership.To date, some eight days since collection of my Tesla, I have received one Tesla app message telling me that they do not have a technician to look at the car and it will be looked at when one becomes available and one telephone call prior to that message telling me that the car was undergoing diagnostic checks at present.  Based on past experiences, I know which message I'd believe.I would advise anyone thinking of purchasing a Tesla not to see this review or the reviews of others here as the rantings of cranks.  You will have car issues and you will be treated in the same shoddy manner by Tesla.    I have been given better after sales service by second hand car dealers on car purchases costing less than €5000.  Car collected , replacement vehicle delivered to my place of work and my car dropped back after repair. Customer service ensuring the customers needs are met.The car, a delight to drive and ownership a horror but thats purely as a result of having to deal with Tesla. Would I buy another one?

Period.I wanted to trade my 2017 Model X for a 2021 Model Y.  In an ideal world, I would like to know the price of the new car, the trade in value of the old car, and have the ability to have Tesla pick up the old car and deliver the newer one to my house in SC  from my computer or phone.   IMPOSSIBLE (but you can easily do so with Carmax or Carvana).  But I would rather deal with Tesla - Go Figure.SO I get a hotel in Raleigh the night before to make sure I get delivery on time the next day.  I arrive the day before to make sure they have the car and it is ready to go.

Mind you, the car is already paid for in full.The next day I arrive early, 11 am, to be sure I will be seen on time.  AT 130 PM, I AM TOLD THERE ARE NO KEYS TO THE CAR!!!!!!!!!   They called a tech in and the keys will be made if I want to wait.  I UBER downtown at my expense for a bite.  I return at 5 and still no keys.  I am informed that my phone can act as a key and I can drive home.  THE CAR IS NOT FULLY CHARGED.  I WAIT ANOTHER 30 min for that to happen. As of 48 hours since the purchase, no one has responded to GET ME A KEY TO MY CAR!!!I love my new Tesla though - thank heavens Tesla is a fantastic car - I'm not sure I can tolerate the purchasing process.Oh, and if you go to a Tesla show room expecting to be impressed, you won't be.  Bland white desks.  No videos of the new sportster, new cyber truck, or any other fun Tesla product.  A trip to Best Buy for some 80 inch TV's and some promotional material could really improve the buying experience.

The service reps are very helpful, but the techs are seen goofing off without a sense of purpose.

I purchased a 2022 Model X which was delivered in late February 2022.  Upon delivery I noticed some small issues with the car, curbed wheel, falcon wing door error when closing etc,.  The wheel was replaced and the dealer said they couldn't recreate the falcon wing issue.  2 weeks after that I had the vehicle wrapped in clear paint protection film.  In April the vehicle's security module failed which made the car unable to open or power on. The vehicle was towed to Tesla in Raleigh and sat there for around 10 days waiting on the part and eventual repair.  Between then and June I had several more issues, a piece of wheel trim literally fell off for no reason, trim on the bottom of the vehicle on the passenger side was falling off, falcon wing door issue was still present, one of the rear seatbelts had the buckle installed backwards  so the belt had to be twisted to be buckled, received intermittent safety restraint failure issues and my keys occasionally would stop working.  I dropped the car off on Sunday night July 10th for a 8:15 am July 11th service appointment.  By noon on July 11th I had not heard from anyone and checked my Tesla app to see that the car had not been accessed or moved.  After several texts via the app they told me they didn't realize my car was there and would start the repairs soon.  At 3pm they told me they couldn't access the car and needed the keys, my wife dropped the keys off around 3:30 and a short time later I was told the service would be performed on July 12th and car would be ready by the end of the day.  On July 12th I realized I had not received any communication from them and at 3:00 I checked the app and the car still had not been accessed or moved.  They then informed me that they were having trouble accessing the car and would likely need it until Friday July 15th.  They did not provide a loaner and were unable to get me a rental car so I was without a car this whole period with only $100/day in uber credits.  July 15th came and went with no communication and I noticed the estimated repair date was shifted to the following Monday.  The following Monday they shifted the ETA to Friday.  Friday they told me the car should be repaired by this Monday, July 25th.  The security module had failed a second time along with all of the other repairs.  On July 26th I got a message that the car was ready and that due to the module replacement I would have to repair my keys with the car.  I texted them and asked where the keys would be located as I was picking up after hours and was told I would need to make an appointment to have my keys re paired with the vehicle and they needed at least 72 hours notice.  So because of a faulty part that had to be replaced which un-paired my keys I now have to make another appointment at the service center just to get my key fobs repaired back with the vehicle. I was also told that the falcon wing door issue is being caused by the paint protection film and will not be addressed under warranty.   I have tried on 3-4 different occasions to call them and left voicemails each time with no returned calls.  I loved the car but after this experience I have sold the car and went back to Range Rover.  I would strongly advise against buying a Tesla until they get their build quality issues under control and are able to hire competent staff.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Travis Jack,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/62e11bb4064a37001248d86b/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

This is a non-luxury technology.,"I’ve had a Tesla model X for five years. I’ve watched the customer service deteriorate from luxury car standards befitting a six-figure purchase to a standard worse than what I remember my Honda dealer gave me. The build quality has always been poor, the saving grace was with less moving parts, there was less to go bad. Over time, engineering defects came to light, with structural components of the car unable to bear the increased torque and acceleration the car was famous for. Unfortunately as the car has deteriorated with stock bin components rusting, a huge expansion in ownership of lower cost models meant that the profit margin has decreased, pressure on employees has increased and the service quality has dropped precipitously. Now everybody is being treated like they have bought an entry-level car and should be grateful to have a Tesla at all. Frankly at this point I dread dealing with service issues through their God-awful app, and found going to the dealership only a marginally better way of communicating the car’s service needs and minimizing the impact of losing my mode of  transport.  When I mentioned this to the beleaguered service advisor at my local Tesla service station his reply was: “We have too many customers coming in per day. There is no comparison between Tesla today and 5 years ago.” At this point, instead of being customer oriented, Tesla employees’ attitude is “take it or leave it”As soon as there is another car offering similar technology with better quality and service, trust me, I will take that.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Naren Gupta,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/62e11cc3cb923700121bf6c9/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

I want to be clear that I have owned a 2017 Model S for several years and I love driving the car.  However, Tesla customer service is Missing In Action.  It is nearly impossible to reach a live human being to ask a question or clarify an issue.  The customer has to use the mobile app or website and then hope for a response.  I had a breakdown in the car in 2021 that was a drive train issue - coolant system malfunctioned and shut the power off. Because I was out of the general warranty, Tesla told me I had to arrange for my own tow which I did.  Once I picked up the car it took several days to get it repaired.  Not 10 miles from the service center the car malfunctioned again ON THE FREEWAY.  Luckily, I was able to exit the freeway and get to a safe parking spot.  Again, I called Tesla and they refused to arrange a tow for me because I was out of the general warranty.  I explained that the issue was related to the drive train and thus covered by the 100,000 mile warranty.  The robotic person I spoke with could not even check the repair record to confirm that and I had to arrange a tow by myself.  I have not had a really good customer experience with Tesla and they want every contact with customers to be electronic.  Tesla is doing its best to eliminate people to assist in customer service. I will be trading in my Tesla next year and buy a new EV.

In January, 2022 I get a note from Tesla saying my car delivery has been moved to July, 2022. Now it’s 11 months to get my car. In May, 2022, Tesla sent me another note stating delivery of my car has been moved again to December - February, 2023. REALLY?? Now I’m looking at between 16-18 months to get my car and I don’t live in an economically depressed country. I live in the US.Since Tesla will not allow anyone to contact them (only to order a vehicle, nothing more) and the Tesla centers are unable or unwilling to provide any help; I sit in the dark, dumbfounded while I wait for Tesla to throw me any breadcrumb of info at their convenience. It would not surprise me if Tesla sent another note pushing my delivery out to 2 full years.

When we asked the dealer what exactly they did with this NEW car, the answer is that they do not know, probably on factory. As a result, they offer us to repair a NEW car which worth almost $ 70,000. I don't even have words to describe my disappointment and horror of what is happening. We pay 70000 for a NEW car and I get a car with obvious and intentional damages and absolutely unclear reasons for these damages. I feel like my family safety is at stake because I don't understand what exactly was done to this car. We were not offered to change the car. We were not offered even discount. I see that tesla doesn’t want to change this car but we bought it as NEW and Tesla offers me to REPAIR intentionally damaged NEW car? So they sold me not new car but intentionally damaged.

We drive a lot of miles each week, we use the car for deliveries: the tax incentive Tesla offered was great. My review is about the number of flat tires we have had and the customer service being the absolute worst experience of any company. The “ Great Customer experience” used as a selling point is a lie. As I was saying, we have had 5 flat tires in 3 years and not one time have they ever helped us or assisted in any way. They claim they will send someone to help, wherever you may be, but they won’t. Never have. Yesterday, I had another flat tire and called the Tesla customer service with a roadside emergency and was on hold for 45 minutes just to be told they had no service truck who could tow me, and basically told me I was “ F!?@!”. Then at the end of the call he asked me “ Is there anything else he could help me with?”, in a antagonizing manner. I told him he hadn’t helped me with anything he told me to “ Relax.” The car is barely worth the 1100.00 we pay a month, but don’t buy one.

I intended to purchase a car through my business and raised my concerns about how long i had been trading for. Dan passed me the no. for the underwriters. I called them and was assured less than 2 years trading wouldn’t be an issue. Now for the not so positivesFast forward I placed my deposit. I then went to setup the finance and the online gateway between Tesla and Lex auto lease didnt work kept saying there was an error. I wasted approx 8 hours over 2 weeks speaking with countless customer service agents. Each time they cited a different reason as to the error I received, several said it was a known problem. Eventually I received an online link to bypass their online gateway. Several hours later that day I received an email advising that I couldnt be offered the finance as I had been trading less than 2 years. ie different to what I was advised originally had I been informed correctly I wouldn't have placed a deposit in the first place. I chased Tesla for a refund they cited that I have no consumer rights as a business but they would speak with a supervisor and call me yesterday. No call received. You can imagine how I felt I went from being frustrated to being insulted I would have considered trying Tesla again in the future but given the shocking treatment forget it. I chased again today and a chap said he would provide a refund I asked for confirmation in writing nothing has been received I’m not so sure the money will ever see my bank again somehow. I contacted Lex auto lease to raise a complaint as the whole situation was frankly a joke and totally avoidable, caused in part by their underwriters.   Lex then made matters worse and advised the underwriter is not black horse yet every bit of documentation states otherwise including my email which details the registered office for black horse.  Lex have since advised a complaint has been raised and will be looked into in 8 weeks time. The agent on the phone agreed about things being unclear. ie acknowledged fault on their part. I honestly cannot recommend Tesla as it stands I am out of pocket to the tune of £200 through no fault of my own.Whilst the performance of a Tesla might tempt most people to switch to electric please take a long hard think before parting with any money. I assure you if you can have these sort of issues at point of sale imagine the issues you might have when something goes horribly wrong with the car.

I was voicing my frustration with the deterioration of Tesla services over the past several years. (expecting the arrival of my 6th Tesla and been buying Teslas since they opened) She was mocking, dismissive, arrogant, openly condescending, argumentative, lacked empathy and clearly had no conflict resolution skills or experience. Her ‘credibility’ was that she has worked at Tesla for 9 years therefore she is qualified to abruptly dispute my experiences and made broad stroke excuses to denigrate my valid points. She represented herself in a very poor light with repetitive & weak excuses.I wish Tesla would teach managers how to communicate with the public instead of watching this manager expose her resolution incompetence through defensiveness and antagonism. I left knowing this Tesla service center is inept and the manager, Maria, lacks fundamental skills for basic customer service. I am a Doctor & research scientist and read people every day. My situation with Maria could have ended equitably had she exercised simple empathy and connection skills. Unfortunately she was not aware of her own behavior. At the end of the day, her antagonistic and ineffective behavior did nothing to reflect positively on herself personally, as a competent manager to the public, or as a Tesla representative. As a loyal customer, I left the Tesla service center today confirming the consistent negative experiences from interactions with Tesla. A single person has the potential to redirect or nullify negative feelings, unfortunately, Maria added to the growing toxic customer service symptoms by the Tesla community. I brought my car to this Tesla center at my appointment time for a simple tire change. I am told it will take a minimum of 5 hours to change a tire!

When I phoned up to find out what was going on I was told there was a problem with the communications which is scandalous as this company send people into space I have millions of satellites, but could not pick up the phone.The guy on the phone who took 45 minutes to answer also preferred to lie to me where the delivery van was and what I’ve gone on during the day. When I went to the show room for some help the guy at the show room was so rude in hindsight I wish to punch his lights out . They have now looked into the matter and say they’re going to do something about it but with there form I don’t believe a word they say. They have also completely refused to offer me any compensation for all the time I’ve spent on this matter not even a gesture of goodwill but apparently it’s worth a £45 Tesla voucher.

It's fun to drive.However, Tesla as a company to deal with . . . horrible.  I paid over $100K for my car and received better customer service when I had a $20K Honda.  In 2019 Tesla pushed out an over the air update which reduced the charge range of my car.  The equivalent of shrinking my gas tank.  There was no communication and at first they denied anything (if you could contact a human being).  Well, this past week I received my notice of settlement of the Class Action and will receive a whopping $625.  Mind you, this update caused me extra on road charging time when I was commuting weekly between Northern and Southern California.So, what next you ask?  My monitor died (the brains of the car).  The replacement was going to take over a month to receive so I agreed to buy a refurbished monitor which did save me a few hundred dollars.  A week later I learned there was a recall and my car was eligible for reimbursement.  I filed the warranty claim for reimbursement (over $1,300) and the online screen confirmed eligibility.  That was 2 years ago!!! I have tried several times to contact someone who can help and have spent close to 10 hours trying to get this resolved.  I thought I finally found someone at the local location who tried to assist in navigating but they seemed to have also thrown up their hands.

I actually loved my car, drove smoothly and quietly, but then I didn’t even reached 120k miles on it when the high voltage battery completely died on me. I parked one day at work with 80% charge and got out from work to find the battery completely drained to the point of not even starting or being able to put into neutral to push it to a charging stall. I left the car plugged in using 3 extension cords for the entire weekend (still at my job’s parking lot) and it didn’t take any charge at all and never turned back on again. I towed it to the nearest Tesla service center and after over a week they told me the battery had completely died and it needed full replacement to the tune of $23k (the car’s average value in the best condition possible and long range trim is ~$26k). I asked about warranty coverage and they told me I was out (over 100k miles and just at the 8 year mark). I asked hypothetically if I had the money for the repair what their warranty would be and they said 50k miles on the battery only.The message is: DON’T BUY USED TESLAS but if you do make sure you’re still within the warranty period. GET RID OF THE CAR BEFORE THE FACTORY WARRANTY EXPIRES, after that all bets are off, it may very well become a bottomless money pit. DON’T EVER BUY A TESLA WITH NEW BATTERY thinking that it’s like buying a new car - it isn’t, you’re only covered for 50k miles on a fresh battery - completely wasteful and senseless.It’s a great, fun, and classy car while the warranty lasts (service is great and at no cost for warranty covered items, no questions asked).

( it’s easier for a camel to go threw a eye of a needle than a rich man make it into heaven.)   Why tho would you not support a company that makes jobs in America. Instead of supporting corporations that do not an build there vehicles out of America.  An charge a huge amount of money for them. Just to build them the cheapest way they can. Why support company’s that take away from are economy. Instead of a company that helps support Americans.

I logged into my manage account section on Tesla and I saw that my delivery was moved out two months. Unfortunately the new later date did not work for me. I canceled the order and wrote that I wanted my deposit back. When I purchased the car I entered into a contract with Tesla. Delivery date is part of the contract. They totally ignored my request for a refund and also I had requested a return label to return the charger. Trying to contact them is a maddening experience. I finally found a phone number for them. Three days ago I called. I did not wish to wait for a rep so I requested a callback. Three days later no callback and no email. I guess I made the mistake when they said reason for the call and I indicated cancellation. Horrendous customer service. I will never get a Tesla knowing how poorly they treat their customers.,,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,norman weiss,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/622f94d8461cfe0012d4e6aa/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

My first car was a Mark 2 Ford Escort. An old banger, but I never had a situation where I couldn't get in the car, or if I did, couldn't start it. With the Tesla Model S I've had several such situations. I've had this car for 6 years and during that time it has caused me a great deal of anguish, heartache, road rage, and sheer inconvenience. Right now, the car has stopped recognising the key, so the only way I can get in the car is by using my phone, which only works sometimes. Customer service have basically not given a monkeys. Just use the app to book a service appointment, they say, which usually books you in around 3 weeks time. Sadly this is not a one off. I've had various problems over all the 6 years I've had the car. The passenger door won't open from the outside. The window would open randomly in the middle of the night. Rear door would just randomly open. Not to mention really inconsistent auto pilot performance. The radio turns off intermittently when I use the rear demister. I can't imagine any of these things happening with a Merc, BMW, Audi. The car is fast though, that is true. The other major thing is that the car is ergonomically diabolical. I have had hip injuries as a direct result of the awful seat position, and lack of support / stability in the seats. This is the main reason I am changing marques asap. Despite the speed of the car I have to give a 1 star review because it is so far short of basic standards that I would expect from a car of this price.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Carl Elsby,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/604918d94ab2b600193fbb76/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

I feel that strongly about how bad Tesla's company service is, so if anyone reading this is thinking of buying a Tesla I recommend staying away.I will try to keep this short.  I moved from BMW to Tesla, after many hassle free years at BMW, but it felt like Tesla was the go-top place for EV's so I switched over.Firstly, my brand new car turned up with scrapes all over it and filthy.  Then I go to charge my phone and find out that they have sent the car without front USB ports or charging pads.  So I complain to Tesla and it is like dealing with robots at their customer services, there is no humility whatsoever. Car had to go back in to have the scrapes repaired and basically a 3 month wait for USB's to be installed.  All I got from Tesla was a copy of T's and C's effectively saying tough luck, we do not care that you have damage to your new vehicle and we will hopefully get the charge ports in, in a few months.  So an incomplete and damaged car owned for months and taking my time to get the car back to them for repairs which naturally costs me money and inconvenience.  As above, all I got was a load of T's and C's and an offer of a £45 Tesla gift card - insulting!  I then refused the gift card and asked for Tesla to make an equivalent donation of £45 to charity.  Guess what, the robots at Tesla Customer Service cannot even do this as it is not company policy.  Disgusting, it is all about profits.As you own the car, you will then find that the vehicle that you have delivered could be totally different to your next door neighbours.   My car is marketed as having games to play with a controller and Elon Musk tweets to say that every Tesla owner is getting Sonic The Hedgehog.  This is not the case because my car has not got data carrying USB sockets so I cannot use a controller.  You then read about different computer chips and radar systems etc.The long and short of this is Tesla have absolute no customer service when things go wrong and will not even make a payment to charity in lieu of a voucher which tells me exactly the company that they are.Avoid avoid avoid.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,George’s Playhouse,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/62165f1d44d3300014c9398c/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

My insider sales Adviser was Ryan McClain, very helpful sales person.  My Tesla was supposed to be delivered in November 2021, then it was delayed to December and then  to January 9th, 2022. The delivery was postponed due to some unknown reasons to February 20th, 2022.  Then it was delayed to March 19th 2022 and now it is delayed to April 24th 2022.When I reserved my Tesla Y, I also ordered a BMW X5 from Peter Pan BMW dealership. I was given a VIN number. I tracked it through production process. It was supped to be derived in the last week of December 2021 . It was ready to be picked up on schedule on December 31st 2021.  I picked it up on January 2nd, 2022.  Excellent service.Manufacturing of a car is supposed to take weeks not months.  I understand when the demand is higher than the production, it takes time to get it, some time months. The delivery can be predicted by sequence of manufacturing.  There can be delay of few days or weeks, but not months.  Tesla is the top technology car manufacturer in the world.  They are supposed have a state of the art tracking system.  My expectations from Tesla were very high. I fail to understand what went wrong here.  I am very much puzzled.  If I had know that Tesla is irresponsible and delivery is so unpredictable, I would have gone with some other EV.

In the meantime we go to the DMV and my husband gets his driver licence we put it on the Tesla website and miracle the car is still available we book an appointment to pick it up to days later, but there is a problem on the website we can’t book the insurance because my husband was remove from the file (even if we Were co-leasing the car and we got it depending on both our pays). We go back to the store and they tell us sorry you need to to it again from the start and it could take several days to be approve you should postpone your appointment to pick up the car, we insist and insist again and finally a manager come and help us and say that there was a mistake because it’s impossible that he is not on the file if it’s a co-lease: he solve the problem in a few hours and then we are able to go to the shop where we are supposed to pick it up (1 hour from home) on time for the appointment, when we arrive for the appointment they tell us we are sorry but there was a problem when you book it and We don’t have your appointment here so your car is not ready come back in 3hours(!!!) to pick it up so we explain that we just did a 1 hour trip to pick it up and we are not going to go back home now and we wan’t the car after several minutes she tell us that the car will be ready in 30 minutes, it was ready 1 hour later and that’s how we finally got our Tesla: no commercial gesture for the worst customer service ever but we didn’t expect anything else.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Jade Hayat,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/61eeddb1204b0c0012af79d1/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

The diagnose was rear drive component failure with is like an engine failed in traditional car. Tesla service station replaced it under warranty, they better!

I asked Tesla to give me a new car, was told the new parts were put in so it is as a new one! Sounds like a used car dealer! Service was slow and after they were done they didn’t even clean it for you.

I put in a Service Ticket before having it towed to service center as I wanted to prepare them and make sure they could receive my car.  No one ever responded over 3 days!  I finally called roadside assistance and asked them to please message my service center and make sure it was OK for me to drop off my car there at the Service Center (they never did confirm my appointment time).

It was a set of Konig Summit K45 chains for my Tesla Model S. I was testing the chains before heading out for my Yosemite trip and to my horror, the chains were coming off every time. I followed all the instructions on Konig's website and the videos available. Tesla's own website, surprisingly, has a dated demo video that is for a completely different set of tire chains. I even took the car to a service center so that a technician could look at it and the chains were coming off even then. The technician helped me raise a request for a return. It has been a week since then and nobody has even bothered to acknowledge or reach out. Furthermore, my email to their online orders team that is responsible for managing the returns, hasn't even been acknowledged or responded to by the concerned team. I called their customer service helpline and I was told every time that it is the online orders team that can help me out.Glad that I didn't head out on my trip. The worst part is Tesla does not realize the fact that this can cause an accident on a snowy/icy road.

My account said that delivery was scheduled for 12/10, which came and went without any communication. A few days later the scheduled delivery date was updated to 12/18 on the account website. 12/18 came and went with no communication and no response to attempts to reach Tesla.  My car arrived on 12/27. I had not received any notification by email, phone, or text that the car would arrive on that day. Fortunately, I was at home when it arrived.  The car had not been prepped for delivery. It was missing hub covers from all 4 wheels. it had shipping tape and plastic covering the interior columns. A large foam shipping block was glued to the front passenger door. The interior door panels and carpets were dirty. Attempts to reach the Paramus Delivery Center by email and text received no response. No phone number for the Paramus Delivery Center is provided online.  I called the national Tesla customer service number. The person there said that the Paramus Operations Manager would call me. Instead, I got an email that the wheel hub covers have been ordered and will ship to my home from California, presumably for me to install myself.  There was no mention of resolving the other issues. For a ""premium"" vehicle company, Tesla's delivery and customer service is TERRIBLE, DISGUSTING.I eventually did get a call from the Paramus Operations Manager.  He said that the car came with hub covers, and they don't know when they were misplaced.

They didn't contact me again until I contacted them.  They didn't have any updates and just kept slipping the delivery date by updating the delivery date in my account.  They never called or even texted me.  Worse when I texted my Tesla POC they just disappeared.  Never answered and I never heard from them again.  Finally after calling and being put on hold for hours I got through to a person.  They weren't much help.  I did eventually get the car in late October. Like all Teslas there were misaligned body panels that had to be adjusted.  So I had to take it back for service.Tesla registers the car for you.  You pay the registration fee but they register the car and get your license plates.  Of course they can't do this right away so they give you 30 day tags.  The 30 days came and went with no permanent license plates.  I called Tesla long before the 30 days were up and again waited on hold for hours and they couldn't figure out how to get the license plates.

Don't buy anything from them!,"I'm writing about Telsa solar panel customer service. I'm just mad and want to review them somewhere.Solar City was my original company, bought by Tesla (insert throw up emoji). Since then, every requirement for Tesla customer service fills me with DREAD. Why? Two years ago, at Telsa's direction (they said it would be nearly a year before their techs were available and everyone uses their local roofers for the work), I paid lots of money to have a roofing company remove and ""reinstall"" my panels when I needed a new roof. When they couldn't figure out how to reinstall (all they had were the original install diagrams, sent many times to me by Tesla), and MANY calls to Telsa giving me the same guidance, I finally pulled the speak to a manager BS, got a local Tesla panel installer on the phone and found out roofers should NEVER have uninstalled the panels and would not have the (new) hardware to needed to reinstall. He was shocked that customer service just kept sending my installation plans and thought a non-specialist could do this. Also, I paid for everything twice. Did Tesla care? No! They told me I was ""getting a deal"" and it was usually ""twice the cost"" to reinstall. Great, almost $2,000 and over a month of my panels sitting useless in my garage.Cut to today: I get a text that my system is no longer working and needs to be repaired. The only directions are to schedule service via the Telsa app (the website is not an option...why??). I download it and log in except, whoops, it doesn't work and just kicks me to the login screen. I reset my password. Twice. Same glitch. I find a service number call, wait, the call is dropped. I call back and wait again. Somehow, I talk to someone nice and she takes on the repair scheduling herself. Only one option, but my six hour repair window in a few weeks is scheduled. I'm lucky to have the date (and I believe her)...sounds like I got a canceled spot.I just want to say: Telsa the brand has this gloss, this high tech wonderland image. The reality is their customer support is HELL. Their app doesn't work (how does that fit their brand image?). Their systems are beyond buggy and seem completely untested before they launch with customers. Their customer support specialists are often given the wrong guidance and provide you with expensive, incorrect information (see roofing story). And while I bought an electric car recently, not for ONE SECOND did I consider a Telsa. Was a shocked today to find endless reviews saying people couldn't get help, couldn't schedule car repairs? Of course not! Oh, I also noticed that their bad customer service reviews seem buried under fake crap. AKA, I guarantee they pay for this and want new customers to see 4 star customers ratings the first time they want to learn about Tesla customer service experiences. Newsflash: the actual rating should be around the Comcast level: 1.5 ish, on a good day.This brand is about flash, ego, and gives me con vibes. Cool car bro, hope you like waiting on hold!

Loud pitch squeals, faulty sensors and also software issues which has caused the screen and reversing cameras to stop working at points.Service staff are polite but come across as unhelpful due to the processes and hoops you have to jump through. There seems to be a lot of cars with issues and getting an appointment initially can be quick but some issues we felt fobbed off, others required parts which we had to wait weeks for (although a Tesla mobile technician did come to us in the end which was good). Other issues involves waiting at the Tesla centre for them to diagnose or waiting 6-8 weeks  if you need a loan car while they keep yours in. Service staff appear not to have the time or scope to fix certain issues such as the loud pitch whine on one of the cars we have. Despite this being an issue fairly widely reported online and is probably related to one of the cooling pumps the onus is on you to keep a log of when it happens and provide evidence.A fair few issues we have had with the cars actually seem to seemed to be down to the software glitching and fixed by forcing a reset which is done by holding both scroll wheels down on the steering wheel - something that could save a lot of time if they suggested this earlier - for example when the reversing cameras stopped working on one of our Tesla’s and another where the screen went black.The model 3's are great fun to drive and I guess being so heavily software dependent we will probably all have to get used to more 'software' glitches and turning it 'off and on' again across all manufacturers.

I was given delivery options of Monday or Tuesday. Due to recent surgery follow up appointments I couldn’t do Tuesday, and I needed to get the vin to my credit union first thing Monday to generate the loan and check, so I selected Monday evening delivery. Tesla questioned if my payment would be ready and offered to allow an extra day for Wednesday delivery if we couldn’t get it done on Monday. I made it very clear I still wanted Monday if I could get the paperwork done. I was able to get it all put together and verified tracking number of check by 2 pm on Monday, but then tesla told me they  No longer had drivers that evening. They said if I wanted it, I would have to come to Fremont. because of my recent surgery I was not able to drive to Fremont so they rescheduled for Tuesday morning to deliver to my home. Overnight my account was updated to have a new balance of $750. When I inquired first thing in the morning, it turned out that the California fuel reward incentive that had been $1500, reduced to only $750 starting that Tuesday. So basically because they delayed my delivery I now owed $750. I had expected they would make this right as most customer service oriented organizations would. But they stood behind the fact that it wasn’t them who decided to change the amount it was a California. their hands were tied, was what they claimed. The customer service representative tried to defend  Tesla by saying that there was an offer to deliver on Wednesday which would’ve been too late so I shouldn’t be complaining. But I never wanted Wednesday and they never warned me what I would be losing if I waited till Wednesday. I used to sell cars for a living and I know full well they have plenty of room to make this right from their own side, but Tesla doesn’t care because they have the market cornered. don’t expect them to help you out.

I asked about the investigation progress in to the initial incident and how it would be done. I said that I was expecting some contact from Tesla to understand the process. I was told that they can’t do this because they have lots of customers - this makes no sense. The agent on the on the phone just wanted to argue and not listen. Tesla just don’t seem to care that their car might have caused a serious accident, that they have a duty of care and that they can’t supply simple parts.

Email was returned no such person or email address. No one at Tesla has any idea of any email addresses of their top executives.  Guess that sums it up for Tesla, If the Brass don't hear of problem, I guess they don't existMr Walker et al, for the past year or so, I have been exploring the purchase of an Electric Vehicle and finally decided on the new Model S.  Can't tell you how excited I was when I received an email telling me it had arrived.  I scheduled delivery for Tuesday August 31 and confirmed delivery on Monday August 30, so I sold my Lexus ES 300h on that Monday.Well that excitement went quickly down the tubes as I was informed Monday, right after I sold my Lexus the Tesla Model S had a battery issue that needed to be fixed. Since I had just sold my Lexus, I asked for a loaner car since the timeframe for the fix for the battery issue was unknown.  Well coming from Lexus I thought I would get the same type of EXCELLENT customer service from Tesla. Well was I ever wrong. I was told, very firmly I must add, that Tesla could not/would not provide a loaner car as they don't have any. And only after insisting something be done, I was offered the option of using Uber to get to & fro and Tesla would pay the costs.  Seriously, Call an Uber??  One to get where I need to go and another to get me back home for each and every trip? For an unknown period of time? After repeated calls to many different Tesla employees, I finally got Daniel Monez who offered me a Rental car that Tesla would pay for. Took 2.5 days without transportation to get this far.  Finally, They agreed to get me an Enterprise rental car.Well to my surprise, Enterprise, had no cars available and nothing in the near future.  You think I was a bit upset at this?  Answer is YESI'll shorten this up a bit, Tuesday Car not ready, Wednesday, car not ready, Thursday Tech working on the car called in sick, so car not ready, Friday September 3 car not ready, with no end in sight. Still haven't got a rental either. Now it's Tuesday September 7 and still no car no rental, no nothing.I do not want a car that requires the work that needs to be done, I understand this is a totally new design with newer hardware and software and I do want it fixed properly not just fast. But not providing me with a vehicle and making this seem like it is MY problem and not yours is totally unacceptable. Lexus would have bent over backwards to accommodate my request for a LOANER car of the same or similar quality and style without me asking. Tesla has chosen to make the customer beg for three days then make a reservation without confirming the availability of any rental cars.As you can see, my first experience with Tesla Service is well below expected for the price of the car.  And oh, by the way, you had no problem requiring FULL payment prior to delivery and no one has yet to offer any compensation for the inconveniences placed on me by your company.  I find that to be unacceptable as well.  Would you want to be treated in this manner after spending $100K for a car? Do you find this acceptable? Are you happy with your Service policy of not providing transportation to customers?

Also, I called to my employment place and asked them to let me come s little bit late for my shift. In Saturday 4, around 12pm I received a message from Tesla that my insurance card is wrong. I was very surprised because Tesla provided me with a VIN number a time ago. They couldn’t give me a clear answer what happened but they insisted that without new insurance card they can’t deliver me my car. I complied with their request and got a new insurance card within 20 min.

There's a lot of attention to detail and you can tell their software development has a very high priority. The problem is that no priority is given to how they interact with their customers. At least here in Colorado Springs. I got through relatively unscathed when I bought my M3 Performance, but my brother had a horrible experience when he bought his M3 Long Range.First: The company as a whole has zero concept of logistics and tracking. Considering that this is supposed to be a ""luxury"" vehicle company, you would think the sales department would know exactly where every vehicle is as soon as it's off the assembly line and where it's meant to be going. Not the case. They have no idea where any of their vehicles are until practically the day before it arrives at the dealership. This wouldn't matter so much, except for the fact that you could be waiting for several months after ordering your new car.Second: The dealership appraised my brother's trade in (an audi) and he agreed to the amount they offered. However, since they had no way of knowing when his M3 would arrive (months after ordering), he had to keep driving the old car to work. The night before pickup, he filled out all his paperwork and made his payment which included the agreement on the value of his trade. The next day at the dealership, they tried to charge him an extra $400 because he had continued to drive his old car while he was waiting for his Tesla to arrive and was 100 miles over the 1,000 threshold allowed before the value of his trade diminished. Needless to say, we were all pretty pissed that they didn't ask for updated miles before asking him to sign his paperwork and pay for his new car the night before. But, since they already had his money, they were happy to try to screw him over at the 11th hour.Third: After expressing how underhanded something like that was and telling them that it was on them to request an updated photo of the odometer before paperwork had been signed after making him wait for so long, they finally acquiesced to ""doing right"" by us. This only after we argued and fought with them about making my brother pay for their mistake and constantly quoting rules at us rather then thinking of a mutually beneficial solution. Their solution was to offer floor mats and supercharger miles through referral links to offset the extra $400 that was taken off the trade value. Something that could have been done from the very start, but they decided to fight and argue for an hour and a half instead.Fourth: Weeks after pickup, he still hasn't received his floor mats nor any referrals to give him more supercharger miles as was promised by both the sales rep and his manager. All this outside of the fact that there was a manufacturer defect on the rear bumper (looked like it was hit and dented by something on the inside to create a bulge on the outside) which was supposed to be fixed this week but was pushed out another week because… see first section on their dismal organization and logistics issues… Altogether, they make a good car that works well for the most part and is very slick. Their service is exactly the opposite. They are lazy, liars, and completely unwilling to do anything for their customers. I would highly suggest that you document every interaction you have with them because they are slimy as they come.*UPDATE*I didn't think it could get any worse, but I am sadly mistaken. My brother took his vehicle in for the service they had set up (he had been forced to push back a couple of weeks so that they could ""get a new bumper, and paint it). So, he showed up to get his bumper with the factory defect replaced. They made him wait around for over an hour before telling him that they were finished. He went out to look… and they hadn't done anything. The old bumper with the defect was still on the car. They had literally lied to his face, saying that they were working on his car, and then tried to tell him they were done and the replacement was complete.Then, they had the gall to tell him AGAIN that they needed to get another bumper and paint it, which he told them was the entire reason he had been forced to push his appointment out in the first place. So then, they tried to say that it was just at another location and would be a couple days before it arrived for him to get his replacement. Well, days went by without a single peep from them. They will say anything just to get you out the door and out of their hair. They don't make good on any of their promises and readily lie to your face if it means they can pass the buck. I've never experienced such blatant disrespect and disregard for customer service, especially from a ""luxury car"" brand.

For real?,"I received a call at the end of June from a sales agent saying if I don't go online and place an order for a new vehicle over the next couple of days, there would be no chance of receiving a new vehicle by the end of September (end of my current lease). This happened on a couple of consecutive days. After asking what was my total risk and being told the $100 deposit and nothing else, I placed the order. I anticipated the new vehicle to be delivered mid to late September, which is what I was told. I had a business trip in the beginning of August and received a text saying my car was ready for pickup. I responded back; I'm currently on travel for two weeks and will schedule something when I get back. The sales transition person and I had a brief discussion where I was told I only have 3-5 days to get the car or they will sell it to someone else. I said, I'm not changing my travel plans just to pickup the vehicle and if its your policy then go ahead and sell it to the next customer in line or you can wait for me to return. The rep responded; let me check with my manager and get back to you, okay we'll make the exception and hold it for a couple more days until you get back. I arrive back, schedule a day to look at the car one day prior to scheduled pickup and was told to out process the current lease I have. I went through the process and was later told, Tesla no longer does early lease termination and I would need to have two vehicles on lease. Maybe someone should've said that from the beginning? This would've been my 3rd lease going from a Model S 70, to a Model S P100D to a Model S Plaid.

The customer service is the worst I have ever experienced from a car company.  When the car was 5 weeks old, it completely failed.  I returned to the parking lot after lunch and the car was completely dead.  They sent a tow truck to tow it back to the service center (l hour away).  I received an automatic text message telling me to pick up my car within 3 hours of servicing or they would charge me $150/day.  I had to argue with them to tow it back to me since it was THEIR failure.  They did eventually but it required constant arguing.  Second fail was when we were on our way to dinner and in mid trip, I rolled down the window and it would not roll back up.  We had to return home to get another car, were late to meet our friends.  They repaired it 2 weeks later.  Now we have a service order in for a non-functioning seat belt in the back seat.  A small but irritating problem.  I am on my third service date as it keeps changing.  Not what I expect for a car that cost over $80K.  One final problem is that they do not have accurate information on the charging staions (where they are and availability).  This is a big problem for long travel which I don't feel is safe yet because of so many problems.  AND the Tesla app is not always working and it is the main way to get the car fixed.

No response on email and/or questions other than a 'generic' follow up and never response to any proceeding or questions. I'm guessing staff are paid by salary, therefore don't care about the sales / lead outcome and customer satisfaction - otherwise Tesla hired a terrible terrible team of sales and advisors.  Tesla should think of franchising that know how to do sales and other fixed operation of the automotive retail better. Because of this, we have a second thought and maybe is not the best bet for informed public for now.  The worries are what if in the long run we needed assistance about service or future purchases, with these kind of attitudes and mentality of the dealer, (mentality we don't need you and you the one who needed tesla), it is prudent for any informed public to opt for a more traditional brand that still appreciate promptness and up hold and practice customer satisfaction.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Mario S,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/60f85916a7052d001276c15f/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

Picked it up and drove home to find the whole car juddering on pulling left, not an issue before.  Messaged Tesla and next day they called me, I explained the situation and booked it back in a week later. I couldn’t drive it during the week as it felt unsafe .  Today I reluctantly drove it, judders and all, back to Nottingham to be looked at and they gave me a loan car .  Within a couple of hours they phoned me to say they had found some kind of catastrophic damage to the front left wheel and to various parts attached thereto and this was not covered under guarantee.  Let me be clear, there had been no damage to the wheel,  I had simply driven the car home from the Tesla garage the week before.   They implied it was my doing and after a few phone calls it was decided some diagnostic test would be carried out to ascertain when this ‘catastrophe’ happened. I was furious as whatever had happened to my car had occurred whilst in the possession of Tesla Nottingham.  A few heated phone calls were exchanged during the day and then, to my amazement I take the last call from them when they admit it was not in fact ‘catastrophic’ damage to the wheel, in fact they could not find what was wrong with the car !!!  This despite them telling me in great detail earlier about what damage had been caused .  In fairness Callum the technician did apologise for the mistake but it’s left me with a very nasty taste in my mouth.  How could they get it so wrong?  So now they’ve asked me to ‘pop’ back to Nottingham (I dont live anywhere near ) to sit with the technician and point out where the noise/vibration is coming from - seriously you couldn’t write it !

Finally I had to change charging spots.  then, The air condition wne tout in 120 degree weather.  it just blew hot air.  Customer Service and  car service departments are not very helpful.

I begged my husband to buy something else but he always wanted a Tesla so we jumped through all the hoops and horrible customer service anyway.First, our original order was damaged in transit.  They still wanted us to take that car as they were going to fix it ""good as new."" We opted out of taking that car as we've saved for years to be able to buy this and i didn't want a car that has already been in an accident.  Second, we had to reorder and were told 2-4 weeks.  3 weeks after we ordered i got on the tesla site and they had 3 new tesla's online at the local store in the same specks that we ordered.  I called our agent 3 times and never got a response and if you've ever watched the existing inventory it's gone within minutes so i called the store to help reserve it.  They had 1 left by the time I was able to reserve.  The store was very helpful and scheduled a pickup.Third we get to the store for pickup and the chaos ensued.  We paid half from our checking account and had a check from our bank for the balance as explained on the phone 3 days before.  We had a young lady helping who made it more than clear it was her last day ever with tesla.  We gave her the balance certified check from our bank and she said oh we don't take those....  I go outside to find someone who hopefully gave a hoot about us and located a guy who was a little more helpful.  We sat in the lounge for an hour waiting for something.  He finally came back and took the check and walked away.  We sat back in the lounge until our toddler was losing his mind.  The man came in and asked what we were doing?  We didn't know as nobody told us anything.  We then had to go on the tesla site and take delivery of our car.  Lastly we get to our car and a service man got in the car drove it to the back of the building right in front of us.  We walk back in the building and we see the car going back to the original parked site.  We run after him and he tells us ohhh you cannot drive it for 30 minutes because its going through an update.  3 hours later we leave without the car to get lunch.  Come back grab our car and leave hopefully to never come back.  All i have to say i love the tesla but i love my volvo more.  The people at volvo know how to take care of their people maybe Elon should reach out to them for pointers.  Oh and now i cant get rid of the other tesla we ordered as that was supposed to be taken care of and turned into supercharging miles yet here we are with another tesla coming.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Joshua Grollmes,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/60bfa78c9217e1001a646677/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

I put my hundred dollar down deposit to order a Tesla model three. I later called in to upgrade to a more advanced package and the lady told me a certain price on the phone and then sent me a text message to authorize the changes. The price she told me over the phone was not the same as the price that they were charging me. It was going to be more than what she told me over the phone. When I told them I didn’t want to move forward with the changes they said it was too late and the model three had gone up by a thousand dollars in price and now I couldn’t go back to Old price because I agreed to the change. So then I said refund my hundred dollars and they told me that it was nonrefundable. So now I’m stuck either paying $1000 more because they lied to me about the price or I can lose my hundred dollars.

After 5 hours waiting recovery team reached me and took my car . I had to wait another 3 hours for rental car to deliver a curtsy car for me . It was not Tesla obviously - Tesla cars  are not available because they are all in service broken down. I had a phone call from Tesla on next day telling me the reason for this nightmare is a fault in the battery. However the Enginer needs to do further checks because he believes might have other issues. In summary my 6 month old car that cost £85000 is still in service with so many problems. Such a quality car I am hundred percent sure if I brought other brands car for the same value I would not experience the same nightmare and total lack of support from Tesla .In summary the biggest mistake that I even done is buying a Tesla car .Just extremely expensive headache and worry how many miles I can drive before the car break down again:(((((",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,W&A,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5e428f5248e5572f13ea3c1d/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

This took them more than 4 working days and cost me £2450 :'( I had also asked for Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) assessment done which would have cost me additionally. Enquired at the time of leaving the car with them if anything inside (car seats, stuff etc) needs to be removed, was told it wasn't necessary. However, on getting back the car was informed NVH wasn't done because there was stuff inside the car, doh! Brought the car home, the internet issue was fixed but GPS never worked at all. It's been 3 weeks since and it still shows the car location at the service centre :( The Sentry mode was supposed to start recording videos as a result of the MCU upgrade, but never worked. Displays 'saving video' message but when checking out the videos shows no videos found, what a dud!I wasn't offered a courtesy car even though my car is under extended warranty (£3.4K from Tesla). Apparently only the original warranty covers courtesy car, nice! On top of that, each time I talk to the service guys I have to remind them that the car is under extended warranty as their system has no clue about it despite purchasing the Helvetica warranty through the Tesla site!! Now I have to take the car back in for them to fix the GPS and Sentry Dashcam issue which happened as a result of them doing a half-arsed job in the first place and lo and behold I wouldn't get a courtesy car. Why? Because according to Tesla I don't even have a warranty, forget about paying £3.4K for the extended warranty through the Tesla site.

I’d heard all about the Tesla service experience but just hoped I’d never need it. Ping! Up pops Tesla Birmingham...first impressions? Oh my, they got it all wrong. This is soooo much better than the BMW experience. Turns out that’s just because of one decent human being. Beyond that, it’s very much ‘as you were’. I’m almost too exhausted to give you all the finer detail, as tiresome as it was. But the crux of the outcome is as follows:* car was collected post fix by my (disabled) husband and it involved him being locked out of both my car and the Service centre staff for quite some time (who seemed mightily miffed my husband had dared insist they hand him the actual car key back)* Car wasn’t clean on the outside when it went in (I live close to several working farms, so not easy unless you have time to wash the car every day) BUT the inside WAS clean...until the person who presumably took the wheel trim off decided to not wash/wipe their hands before getting into my car, thereby smearing muck all over the inside of the door...and beyond. There was also some weird black sticky substance on the seat, which took some elbow grease to get off...* Wheel trim on wheel that they’d replaced the tyre on kept popping off, but of course there was no evidence to suggest it was their fault...nothing to do with the fact they’d changed the tyre or anything...but if I tried to fix it myself I’d invalidate the entire warranty, apparently. Had to go back in, apparently...* Moreover, the key card, which had worked perfectly well pre visit, suddenly stopped working properly. It was stored in a key card holder for the last 14 months and stood the test of time, but when removed from the casing was found to be completely cracked...but of course, on calling Tesla, it has nothing to do with it being in their possession and we’d have to pay for the replacement...So, my thoughts? The car might be a winner, but the service is very much as reported - shocking. Thankfully, by the time my next company car is due for order there’ll be many, many more options for full electric on the market. My advice?

I feel like a fool to have spent $55,000 dollars on a car where the service department treats us like crap   We bought the model Y. Dealership told us this car would be great in the snow. It’s terrible until you buy the expensive snow tires they sell. But they have no tires in stock until spring.(It’s Early November when we are trying to purchase) So we are forced to buy another tire. We buy 4 new expensive tires that are recommended for Tesla. Service then tells us that it’s our fault we didn’t wait until March to buy their snow tire and that we let the tire shop install the tires. That irresponsible move voided the warranty. Tesla is no longer responsible for the tire sensors that will not reset. Unless of course we pay them more.  Key card shatters in my wallet. It’s not Tesla’s fault.

It did not come with the tow hitch when it arrived. No worries. They will install one for me. Tesla service charges my credit card $400 above the $1000 price I was quoted    I ask them why and they tell me this is the cost if they have to add it to the car.

One other thing, if it goes wrong for you, as it did for me, forget it if you think anyone at Tesla will be interested in helping you. I can, from experience, advise you that they won't, they will quote their own terms and conditions at you via email. In fact you can't even talk to anyone. They take ten days to reply to any email of complaint and you will spend hours on the phone and get know where, this is my experience.

I told Tesla that it was not my fault that it took over a week to get the changes thru. If they responded on the day I ordered, this would not had happen.

I saw it yesterday. I myself drive a lovely MG5 EV which cost me £24,000 after incentives and trade-in, so I wanted to compare my car with the much talked-about Tesla Model 3.I feel I must post here about the car. Quite honestly, I was horrified by shoddy, nasty build quality and numerous faults...all on a brand-new vehicle that cost over twice what my MG5 did. These faults included:Awful panel gaps which varied on just about every panel of the carFront bonnet sitting with one side raised by 2mm and the other side lower. Cause by pathetic plastic grommet things with a built-in thread which twiddled round so easily and put the bonnet out of alignment.Awful paint....dull, lustreless (and it’s an optional paint colour which cost more) and blotchy in places.Plastic sill cover which actually bowed out by 3mm in the middle, allowing road filth etc to get behind it.Front driver’s mudflap hanging off the car by 10mmCondensation in the rear lightsCheap-looking, ugly, austere interiorA massive, ugly iPad screen thing dangling off the dashboardNasty steering wheel which feels really cheapRear lights not lining up correctly when the tailgate is closed.Truly the most awful, unattractive styling I’ve ever seen in a car.The car looked like a tired, 5 year old vehicle.I’ve wanted a Tesla for years and settled on the MG5EV simply because of the price. BUT....and I mean this absolutely sincerely, if someone said I could swap my car for that Tesla but not be allowed to sell it and have to use it.....I wouldn’t. Truly. Thank heavens I didn’t buy one.My MG5EV has a real range of 185 miles and my acquaintance with the Model 3 says he gets 220 miles. But...the car is double the price of mine and mine is absolutely gorgeous to look at with excellent build quality. Yep, it lacks some of the features of the Tesla but so what? Having seen this brand-new, £48k Tesla Model 3 there’s no way in hell I’d ever buy one. If I owned Tesla shares, I’d sell them because that car is truly appalling and if they are banking on corporate success by making something as awful as that, I wouldn’t risk my money.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,James,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/56b0c3a50000ff000a023dce/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

It holds road well, roomy and carries weight of 2-3 bikes on non-Tesla bike rack very well. From design standpoint, we did not feel comfortable with door handles design. We also feel drive shifting gear is not well designed. It does not feel solid and reliable and feels basically in the wrong place. It should be down on the right side next to seat, where it is physically more natural and faster for humans to operate with hand down. BMW for example has it down to perfection - why not just emulate good design? One other issue we noticed is Tesla's approach to handling customers' money - it can be far more efficient. We initially paid extra amount planning to pay car off right away, but ended up financing. Instead if refunding quickly (hello Tesla -we can use Square or Apple pay these days!) it looks like company holds customers funds and it is becoming a ""discussion"" educating Tesla how to pay customers funds back in modern way. Company may be trying to reuse customer funds short-term but it is not correct either. We can only guess what is going on but hope to receive our funds soon. Trust is important. As separate item we also noticed that Tesla customer service is for some reason reluctant to use emails or texts and appears very old fashioned and not technologically savvy to respond via modern means when asked. When we were with BMW everyone seemed fairly modern and actively used emails and texts.

At 7:18M on Saturday I got an alert on my phone to saying charging interrupted with the battery at 148 miles. (apparently no one has told tesla Dartford this, which I find hard to believe as the customer service recovery rep saw this)3. At 9:30am on Saturday when I went to leave for my journey, the car doors wouldn’t only open a few inches and the car wouldn’t turn on.4. I then waited 40 minutes to get through to tesla customer services and then hung up. I took another car.5. At 5pm I called tesla customer services again was told the car needed to be recovered.6. Tesla contracted a company knowing the car was dead, to come and see if they recover. The car can’t be dragged or winched, so the chap had to beg to get another recovery truck to come and pick up the tesla by its wheels. (apparently they don't like to pay to use this type of recovery)7. I get a message on Monday from Tesla stating that I need to pay £87 to ‘inspect the car’ which I ok’d as was told I would get refunded if warrantable item.9. They then send me a further message saying your ‘technician’ says I need to replace a 12V battery due to the fact the car has been ‘offline’ over the maximum amount of time. Funny this cost £232 pounds inc vat.10. I called to understand why this was my fault, I was told a few things that didn’t make sense, stating my charger was faulty and was told the ‘master technician’ will have to call you to explain.11. I asked to make a formal complaint and speak to someone, I was told someone would call no one is here as its 430pm , you then send me an SMS message saying I need to e-mail LDF@ Subsequently two months prior a Brake Carrier was scraping against the vehicle and I was told that 'I must of done this' and bent metal behind a alloy wheel. When I ask how did I bend this ?TESLA advise :Unfortunately its very hard for us to give an example of that as its not something we have seen before. We can only advise what we have found upon inspection and what we have done to rectify the concern. He has advised it seems unlikely that something has got caught in there as you would need some force to be able to bend the backing plate to how it was.

Were all set to trade in our Model 3 for a Model Y due to end of year incentives. Cleaned out the car and showed up to the dealership on Dec 31 (which was an hour away versus the one 15 minutes from us) only to be told that the pictures from the trade in weren’t good and would have to be redone. Logan assured us as we’re driving out there that the process will be straightened out by the time we get there. But hey, it’s okay, because we’re assured by Logan that it will be exactly the same if we buy in January aside from the charging bonus but he could probably “work something out” through the referral program. He doesn’t. Not sure he actually tried in the end. Then suddenly, despite barely driving the car, our trade in value is redone and drops $3500. Logan says he’ll “fight” with them to match the December value. He doesn’t. At this point, given the snowy weather, we decide to wait until the spring so we don’t have to go through the snow tire to regular tire exchange we had to in January. Logan tells us we’ll again have to take pics of the car but will see if they can just use the previous ones (which were rejected 4 times with numerous delays). He doesn’t and basically stops taking our calls or responding to texts. Assures us he can get us a trade in value once pictures are retaken/approved and new car in a day. He doesn’t. Finally Logan calls back after, no joke, over a week of no response and repeated texts and phone messages on our end (at this point we’ve had the car valued by a third party seller instead) and says it’ll be even easier now that we don’t have a trade in and we can take possession in a day. He also assures us, when asked, that the new car does have a tow hitch although it says otherwise on paperwork. Despite Logan’s assurances, we are unable to make an appointment for over a week as our specific car isn’t in stock by which time the valuation of the trade in is no longer good and will have to be redone. Also, surprise, surprise, there’s no tow hitch on the car and it’ll cost something like $2k to add on “after market.” The only reason we know this is because we go to the dealership in person and demand to speak to someone.

I had checked beforehand with their contact centre and confirmed that the 14 day rule would still apply (they also confirmed this in writing via their chat facility, of which I have evidence) if I purchased as a B2B customer.However they are refusing the rejection as they are stating a B2B transaction cannot be rejected under any circumstances... this is not in their Terms and Conditions.

I drove 180 miles to get there. I was greeted by a salesman/delivery person right away but he needed the VIN # before he 'found' the car.  It was 20 degrees (NY) outside. Upon finding the car, the salesman noted the screen didn't work properly so it was sent to service. It was then we were invited into the 'showroom,' to get out of the 20 degree overcast day.  Luckily there was 2 seats available in the 'showroom.' The showroom has only 2 customer chairs and is the size of a classroom.  Apparently this is the ""new""  method  of selling & delivering Tesla's. After 40+ minutes (no coffee machine - but someone fetch us coffee from a nearby), the car was ready to look at.  We again went back outside, where I 'looked over' the car and got some basic driving and operation instructions from the salesman. I signed all the paperwork outside in the 20 degree weather. (apparently their new process).    The process took over 2 hours before I drove away in my new car.  The next day unfortunately, the screen was went again (frozen, inoperable).  I got the car home after a 5hr drive, (on Sunday), and made a service call.  The next day the car was towed to the nearest service center which is 50 miles away.  All that said, the actual ride was very good -- although the ""300 mile charge"" went only 200 miles.  I needed to recharge the last 50 miles.  Type of driving and temperature do effect the output of the battery and charge time. I hope Tesla considers revising the delivery process. The pickup site was extremely busy and we couldn't park in the parking lot. Instead we needed to park on the street. I want to charge the car 'full' because I was traveling a long distance.  When I asked for a full charge, the salesman told me 'not now,'  because 2 of 2 ports were already in use.  I realize the car can 'sell itself' but the delivery process, the checklist process and the service really needs to be cleaned up.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Mary H.  ,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/6047a5b38a767c00198b48b4/,Rating,5,1,2,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

Only noticed this when picked up my mobile phone showing on Tesla app an alarm triggered message.  Although the car was badly damaged, we were thanking God that it has not gone straight out on the road. In our 40 years of living in London we haven’t seen or experienced any thing like this. The bigger shock was yet to come. The Customer service did not accept  any responsibility for it and refuse to foot the repair bill which would be in thousands.  Although it is a problem mentioned in there manual for model 3, yet it was never pointed out to us at the times of sales. When we were asked to choose the tyres, we were not warned about the problem, if we will not take the winter tyres.

If Tesla knew this then why weren’t customers informed? In my case it would have saved me lots of time and frustration and to be honest had I been told the car was faulty before I took delivery I would have  re-scheduled my delivery and insisted the car was perfect before it was handed over to me.Sadly despite me having emailed Tesla Manchester for an explanation two weeks ago I am still awaiting a reply?I have subsequently spoken to three members of staff at Tesla Manchester and had a variety of responses to my concerns but as yet no one has convinced me that Tesla care at all about their customers.As one lady at Manchester put it Tesla are a victim of their own success having sold so many cars recently and are now unable to provide the necessary after sales service, as their dealership network hasn’t grown in proportion to their sales- all well and good for Tesla but ultimately bad news for their customers.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Mark Davies,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5820c5aa0000ff000a54fc3e/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

I'm perfectly happy buying goods online and expected this transaction to go smoothly. However there's more to buying a car than there is going to Ocado to do a shop. After many frustrations along the way (and wishing l hadn't signed a purchase contract) l finally got a delivery date. It is 48 hours away at time of writing (Sat 19/12/2020).But l cannot insure it - so how can l collect it? I can't insure it because l don't have a registration number. The plates are probably on the car but nobody answers emails and the nuclear codes would be easier to find than a Tesla phone number. No doubt l'll get a phone call on Saturday asking why l'm not there to take the car.If there was an option to get my money back and forget about the whole thing l'd jump at the chance. I dread to think what happens if the are any issues with the car after taking delivery.POST DELIVERY Finally got the reg number a few hours before the collection time.The collection process was a chaotic bun fight - in keeping with the buying experience. More akin to picking up rations in a war zone refugee camp.A sense of relief when driving away and the car is everything that l hoped for.It's OK for Tesla to give a different experience to the conventional mainstream dealer one - but l don't see why it has to be an unpleasant one.,,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Trevor,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/50a6036c000064000127215f/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

Every time we have taken the vehicle in for service on warrantied items, they have tried as hard as they can to blame any damage or non-working part on me with the explanation, ""well we don't know how you drive this car so..."". Funny thing is, one of the complaints was a small chip behind the glass on the rear-view mirror. There was NO damage to the side of the housing and the chip was obviously inside the glass with no cracks.""You took a walk around the car to check for defects upon delivery. It's not our fault that the inspection was incomplete."" This is horrible customer service on items that you won't notice on a general delivery inspection. Nothing but push-back and then taking the windshield replacement out of their service offerings with NO warning on the mobile app. I got into the SC only to be turned away from a appointment due to windshield glass.  I used to have confidence in the SC team but I just cannot continue to give glowing reviews after their recent treatment on a car we spent over $60k on. The vehicles are too expensive to be treated like a '00 at a used car shop. We had a price adjustment on FSD that was supposed to be honored but we can't even get an answer regarding the payment amount at the full amount. They are great until you need something like glass. I didn't receive any communication about the windshield replacement not being available prior to the appointment, which would have helped my expectations for my appointment request. Instead we now feel like we've been mistreated and pushed away even though we have a year left on our warranty and many miles to go before we run out. Certainly this is normal for any warranty claim at many other dealers but you're usually paying $10k for the vehicle itself and they don't have problems replacing glass that isn't first party. Now, it is an indeterminant time for arrival of a replacement, meanwhile we have a large crack in our windshield that makes driving dangerous when light hits it.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Jeremy Trader,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5fada364f4b947001bcba5ff/,Rating,5,1,2,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

Dear Tesla, please treat my review as a constructive review.I have had 2 Tesla - Model S from 2017 and Model X from late 2018.  I also have solar panels and power walls, so I have been a loyal customer.When I had my Model S, service was so great, and service center reps were really knowledgeable.  I can't say the same about a recent experience.  Model X had an issue with the FSD computer and I made an appointment with the service center.  They ordered the part and asked to wait before it arrives.  I noticed that the part ordered was an older version than my car had.  After I updated them that the FSD computer was incorrect, they acknowledged it and stopped any communications for over a week.  I called them back.  Finally, they made an appointment and I brought my car in.  The rep did not seem like understood all the concerns I had about the FSD computer, and was really insistent that they would not cover anything else, while I was just listing the symptoms of the same concern.  He got really protective of his statement that they only were going to address the autopilot.I got an Uber voucher and left.  Later he texted me that they have a loaner car, and I can get it, which I did, it's much more convenient, so thank you.  The car was standing there, and no one had looked at it yet.

The car handover involved standing in a scruffy Tesla carpark and being told my car was ""over there"".  There sat a grubby, uncleaned car. Inside it was still covered in sticky tape from transit.  After a discussion about whether to accept the car in this state, we decided we would and we'd just clean it up ourselves when home.  We almost didn't make it home, as the car had virtually no battery charge and on the way home errors appeared on the screen warning of a faulty camera. Upon closer inspection once home, we noticed a surprisingly poor build quality, such as a misaligned door panel and dodgy lumps under the paint on a wheel arch.  The charging cable looked like it was third hand at best (I discovered later that we weren't given the second cable that was supposed to come with the car).  The floor mats were left in the boot, along with some mud flaps and the rear light cluster was fogged with condensation.  Overall not at all impressed with the quality of car and clearly there is no quality control before handover or the obvious camera fault would have been picked up.I couldn't discus any of these issues with anyone, as it turns out Tesla have no phone support.  Sales will answer, but tell you to email customer services, to which you get an automated response saying someone will reply within 10 days.  I managed to book a repair for two issue via the phone app, but both repairs resulted in further damage to the car (paint chipped changing camera and trim damage made worse).  It's hard to think of anything that didn't go wrong during this purchase.  From the outset there were basic errors, such as being given the wrong car registration number, the vehicle registered keeper being wrong and then there was outright dishonesty; being told the camera was fixed with a software update, as opposed to actually being changed for a new one. It was at this point that I started to Google Tesla reviews, to see what I was dealing with and, oh my Lord, what a shocker!  I read about bumpers falling off, seat belts not connected to the car, a steering wheel falling off and a sun roof blowing off.  Being used to mainstream brands in Europe with dealerships who show a level of competence, who you can actually call and who are honest, I just couldn't be dealing with this stress (plus I was now seriously worried about safety) and so I returned the car under the 7 day returns policy (which I see has now been removed, I can only assume too many people were using it?!).  Other factors in our decision to return the car were that the central screen, with no dash behind the wheel, is borderline dangerous. The voice control doesn't work at all (it can't even recognise basic commands such as ""call John Smith""), the navigation is confusing causing two wrong turns in two days (as opposed to one or two in 4 years of driving our Volvo). Auto-pilot automatically accelerates you to the speed limit of the road, so if you are going fairly slowly on a motorway and you turn it on you are are suddenly launched to 70 mph in an instant which feels so dangerous; the same system on our Volvo allows activates at your existing speed.  I think the only thing we liked was the fart cushion, which had the kids roaring with laughter, but you can't spend £48k for that.After returning the car, I then spent three weeks in total limbo, not knowing what was happening or when/if we would see the £48k back.  No date was ever formally provided for a refund, no communication; nothing. Nothing mentioned in terms and conditions.  We were verbally told 14 days when we returned the car, but that deadline came and went.  A mobile service guy randomly turned up at our house to repair the car that we had returned a week earlier; I told him we'd returned the car, then a week later Tesla called to reschedule the ""missed appointment""!  With no phone number to call and nobody returning my emails, I suffered weeks of sleepness nights and stress worrying if I would need to take Tesla to court to get back the £48k.  The whole time I was sending emails and getting no response.  My confidence in Telsa was so low, I honestly thought going legal would be the only way to get our money back.  It felt like I was dealing with the Mafia.I was so excited when I drove to collect the car and now I actually despise Tesla.  Thank goodness the money has now been returned, but I won't consider buying a Tesla again.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Westworld,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5f282b18baa2f6de76ffeb35/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

As soon as we received the car it was locked on valet mode from the previous owner and most of the options are locked now. The car can be accessed from previous owner's app and they might have key too. We've spoken to Tesla customer service (who are always rude) but they don't want to answer or resolve the issue as we still don't have V5C on our name. We provided proof of purchase but they still argue about V5C document. After spending a lot of money we are getting such an irresponsible behaviour from a well known company.

First of all it sounds like they singled me out of all the clients they ever gotten. Because I doubt they called and sent emails to everybody telling them they can't accommodate them on the dates the clients chose to have their test drives on. The point of booking is you know you are available on the time you are booking the appointment on, not when they think you should come in. They have done that to me twice, literally a day before the date I booked the appointment on. The first time they called and mentioned that they will be changing my appointment dates to another because they don't see me buying a car. Why? Because I am a person of color and I wouldn't be able to afford a Tesla? They emailed me about it as well, from a certain Tesla Advisor named Scott Friedman. it didn't stop there.

Overall the car is great - likely the best car I've ever driven but their support is awful. First experience with support was getting my license plates for the car after purchasing it - they arrived in the mail a day after the temporary plates expired. I spent weeks calling and trying to get a hold of someone to figure out when they were coming in. It was an annoyance, but something I could look over. The latest issue was fairly recently when I went on a long trip and one of their superchargers stopped working mid charge. This happened on a Sunday so their support lines were down and their service centers were closed. I reached out to roadside assistance which told me I could either do 3rd party charging, drive an hour away to the nearest service center and check in with them on Monday, wait until Monday to call their support for assistance, or they could send me a tow at my expense. While these were viable solutions in the moment, it would have been nice if they could have informed me as to whether the issue was with the car or with the supercharger. Not being able to speak directly with a person over the phone and not conveying what the issue is (whether its the car or the supercharger) is unacceptable for such premium luxury products. Furthermore, they need to either expand/improve their service to cover greater hours on peak times (weekends) or allow 3rd parties to work on the cars without consequence. They keep delivering a record number of cars every quarter but unless they increase/improve their support that will not be sustainable. All in all, the latest experience breached my trust I had with them on longer trips and I cannot in good faith recommend them to other people as their primary vehicle.

I have to admit I’m deeply disappointed because this customer care it’s not what you would expect from a high end brand like Tesla. I don’t even know where to start...I received my new car 3 weeks ago and I already have problems with a window defect. It was impossible to get any appointment online with the Tesla service for the next month, despite it being a brand new car. When I called customer service they explained to not worry as it “happens quite often” and they would be able to sort it within 2 hours. Really reassuring they acknowledged an issue and still haven't implement stricter inspections before car delivery. Also really understanding to expect customers to wait for 2 hours in the middle of nowhere as no car replacement is provided, for a defect they didn’t identify despite several previous warnings.Additionally, I was not given the complementary type 2 adaptor to be able to charge my car at home. I explained before I got the car how essential it was for me to have this as I live in a block of flats and I only can charge it on charging points, not from my home. They told me again “to not worry as it will be posted to you as soon as possible”. Three weeks later and three emails later, only one of them got responded yesterday after waiting for at least an acknowledgment for 7 days saying AGAIN “do not worry, it will be posted”. I am not worried, I’m shocked by the very very poor customer care I have received since I purchased my Tesla. It’s infuriating the inaction and the  lack of understanding by the Customer Service team.

Electric cars need to be light, which means they include a lot of high-performing metals. The lithium in the batteries, for example, is super light and conductive—that’s how you get a lot of energy without adding a lot of weight. Other, rare metals are sprinkled throughout the car, mostly in the magnets that are in everything from the headlights to the on-board electronics.But those rare metals come from somewhere—often, from environmentally destructive mines. It’s not just Tesla, of course. All electric vehicles rely on parts with similar environmental issues. Even solar panels depend on rare metals that have to be dug out of the earth and processed in less-than-green ways, says David Abraham, author of the book The Elements of Power.

I figured it would be an easy fix possibly a walk-in appointment. I went by the service center and signed in as instructed by the staff in their lobby. The only way to sign in is by using your phone (see picture#1 attached).  After signing in, I received an acknowledgment back that I would have to wait in my car in the parking lot (due to CV19) and someone would call me on my phone in ""a few minutes"" (see picture#1 attached). After waiting over an hour and not being contacted I made contact with an employee outside who was delivering new vehicles to new customers. He said he would check on my service request. After a few minutes, he returned and told me that no one was working in the service department today the only people there were for delivery prep.I have two problems with this; (1) if no one's working the automated system should NOT tell you to wait in the parking lot. Did they expect me to wait until next week? (2) Prior to filling out the service request on my phone in the Tesla lobby, I spoke with two female employees who instructed me that they were servicing vehicles to use the kiosk or my phone.

One day a car you're looking at will have free supercharging, the next it won't. The very same car.This happened to me. One week I decided to buy a Tesla.  I chose one based on two conditions, it should have full autonomous driving and free rapid charging. After selecting the car I wanted, I put in for a trade in estimate, and contacted my bank to secure funding.I took two extra days to decide if I was going to make the purchase and then went back opened my bookmark and purchase the car.It wasn't until I received a confirmation email of the purchase that I realized that free rapid charging was no longer an option. I immediately (within 2 hours) contacted the used car Tesla representative. I told him what I just laid out and asked what he could do. In short he could do nothing. The option was no longer available. Okay I said refund my money. I will go buy a different car. He informed me that the deposit is non-refundable. Now at this point the car hasn't shipped, the car hasn't been prepared, nothing has been sent save a few emails. I probably put in more work filling out the required forms and taking pictures of my trade-in then Tesla at this point. 2 hours and they would not refund my $500. Naturally I elected not to cancel. Think for a second if you've ever had this experience at a traditional car dealer. You show up to buy a car And they take a non-refundable deposit. It is theirs to keep whether you buy the car or not. Think about that.This was on a Thursday. By Friday afternoon I've received instructions to get insurance on the new Tesla as it would not be turned over without it. I do so and submit the proof of insurance. And wait. End of day Friday and no response, no additional information, no phone calls, no feedback, no nothing. Just think about that. Imagine going to a traditional car dealership, filling out all of the paperwork, providing all of the financial information, and then being asked to wait for an unspecified amount of time. One day goes by, then the next, and nothing.Okay so I call. I contacted the same rep who I had called about the missing supercharging. During our conversation he lets me know that the car will not be ready until Monday. Purchased on Thursday,  available Monday. ""Monday? Isn't this car supposed to be in Atlanta?""I asked. Yes he informed me it was. Granted we are dealing with COVID-19 right now so I give this one a pass.Okay so per the instructions I added that Tesla onto my insurance policy. In addition I replace the car that I was trading in. The change to the policy was set to take effect at midnight. I informed the used car rep that the trade-in would no longer be insured on Monday. That I would prefer to drop it off at the Tesla facility where I would be picking up the car from now, so as not to have to pay for additional insurance.I was told that that was not option. That Tesla would not take possession of the car until the sale was final, and that I could not leave it on the lot because it did not belong to Tesla. It all makes sense but doesn't make for a pleasant car buying experience. Here I am trying to trade in a car and purchase a new one and I am being made to feel like I am being done a favor. That Tesla is being gracious enough to allow me to spend 50k on one of their cars and that I should do all I can to ensure that I get it. This is not what car buying used to be. Granted, used car salesmen had a way of seeming a little oily, but I never felt like my business wasn't appreciated. I never felt like I couldn't change my mind. I never felt like I was being strong armed into a car. Sight unseen, I can't change my mind without forfeiting $500. That's a pretty big deal imo.The entire process is just unfriendly and dissatisfying. I have a bad taste in my mouth and I haven't even seen the car yet. I just can't recommend this to anyone.edit: Monday has come and gone. No word.Tuesday, a text message requesting a picture of my registration via email.

Tesla are a dreadful company who have no value for customer service. I purchased a new Tesla Model 3 long range and the car has a number of issues. The car automatically breaks when on cruise control for no reason, has performed a dangerous emergency stop manoeuvre for no reason in the middle of a busy high street while I had my children in the car and the regenerative braking failed while I came off the motorway onto a slip road.The car doesn't even charge up to 348 miles (the maximum range claimed by Tesla) - and struggles to charge in excess of 300 miles. This is very misleading. Furthermore, the energy consumption is so bad that the remaining mileage on the in-car display will deplete at a far greater rate than the actual mileage travelled. Even with the most conservative of driving, you will consume between 30% - 50% more than the mileage shown. It is most definitely not ""long range"" and Tesla use some very underhanded guidelines to try to 'excuse' their way out of what is quite simply a negligent failure to properly inform its customers of the true ability of the car. Before they have even investigated the matters above they had already stated to me that they do not believe their is any major fault with the car! Failed braking..... random emergency stop.... mileage being consumed at up to 50% more than estimated!!! No major faults eh? This review only touches on the terrible service provided for these and other issues. Yes, there have been other issues too. A damaged roof seal, oil marks on the interior cloth and greasy mark on the rear seats - all present from collection. This was after they failed to deliver the car on the date they first promised. They didn't even fill up my windscreen wash fully and I ran out after a couple skooshes! It would be funny if it hadn't cost me £50,000.After waiting 4 weeks for them to fix my roof seal, glove box and greasy marks, the mobile service technician came to our premises and said he was only there to fix the glovebox and the oily mark. The App (which I had been asked to use so the service team didn't need to speak to me) hadn't told him to do the rest of the jobs. I requested that surely he could at least do the greasy mark on the rear seat as he was here - but 'No - it wasn't on his list'. Pathetic, but true. After waiting 4 weeks for this service, they still couldn't fix the glove box either!They promised they would arrange for a collection and courtesy car to take my car back to the garage to fix the roof seal and glove box. 10 days later and they still hadn't arranged this when I called. A couple other things...The auto-sensor windscreen wipers might not always turn on when the screen is wet, but they will occasionally turn on when the screen is completely dry! Apparently this is expected because the wiper mode is ""in BETA phase"" and will improve once the car learns my habits!There's also a really annoying rattle in the car.Even though all of these things would ordinarily constitute a return of the car under Consumer Rights, unfortunately the same rights do not apply to a business customer. This may be the case, but Tesla could easily have taken the decision to do the right thing and accept the return of the car - which was defective on sale and not in the condition expected of a new car. As it turns out though, ethics is not their strong point.

The driving experience is much better than that of my former Mercedes 220D.  Road holding, acceleration and the thrill of being able to regulate the car just by changing foot pressure on the accelerator are all  terrific.  The automated features work better than might be expected.  Several are still in the beta stage but do a decent job.  Within just over 2 weeks of ownership I have received two performance upgrades already.  It is clearly the best electric car on the road by some considerable margin.  So far, 5/5.  The Tesla back office, support, service and admin systems are a different kettle of fish.  I score these as only 1.8 out of 5.  Do not expect the kind of service level you might receive from Mercedes, Skoda or Citroen (in my personal experience).  Tesla make car buying hard work.  Just enjoy the car when you get it and use the internet for information and advice.   Here is my breakdown of what happened.Test Drives : My first test drive was fun.  Loved the car. Accompanied by a sales person, no pressure.  Second test drive a nightmare.  Just told to drive the car round the congetsed streets of Greenhithe on a prprogrammed route on my own, in a strange vehicle.  Terrible. Score 4/5 (mainly for first test).Web site:  Uses a retail shopping model which does not work that well.  Want to get more information by phone about design and technology now used.  Dream on.  3/5Trade In : Tesla not interested.  Offered me £4k below market for my Mercedes 220d.  (Use Motorway is my recommendation).  3/5Home Charger :  Use Pod Point owned by EDF.  Good service, good backup, good installtion.  No score for Tesla as not owned by them.Sales Process : Sales people froiendly and knowledgeable BUT beware.  They will offer to keep in touch if you need more help.  They won't.  They will promise things Tesla won't deliver and will not honour so only 2/5Waiting period : Sales twema still frinedly and positive.  Sadly they rarely know anything useful or can give you any real information.  Whatever they say, they will never call you back with a follow up.  2/5Tesla videos on You Tube.  Very helpful.  Watch some of these.  best way to get informaiton.Delivery Arrnagements : I was notified about 2 weeks before delivery.  Delivery was not what I had been promised - a direct delivery to my home.  Tesla continued to advertise and promote this service but in practice would not do it.  Information about registraton number held back until the last minute makes insuring more complex.  Also you cannot choose your reg.  2/5Payment in Advance :  you have to pay before taking delivery - fair enough.  Never have I had so much trouble paying a company.  Tesla use Citibank whihc does not comform to the Payee Confirmation System required of British Banks.  your bank will warn you that the tesla Account is a scam and cannot be secure.  I sent a test payment of £10 at firs tbut their finance department is in the Netherlands and it took them 5 days to find it.  (They also lost it again later). A hopeless commercial posture.  1/5Pre-~Delivery : I got a call a couple of days before delivery.  The Tesla person told me my payment was £10 short.  First problem.  After he had found it, I then asked for some Tesla locking wheel nuts to be fitted and for a bigger charge than 40%  No problem I was told.  Turned out to be untrue.  1/5Delivery Day :  It would be hard to design a worse delivery system Than the Tesla centre in Dartford. I have never expienced anything so bad from any other vendor.  Chaoti, disorganised, congested.  Of course they were not ready for the wheel nuts or the charge.  Told me not to bother with my pre-delivery check as they would take no notice anyway.  Tried to get me to take the car out immediatley and park on the double yellow lines on the perimeter road while I set it up.  No tea, coffee or water.  No uniformed staff.  Dress code scruffy jeans, trainers and a t-shirt.  Ugh.  1/5After Sales Service : Does not really exist.  If you can get through when you have a question, a lady with a foreign accent will try to repeat your question then leave on hold whiel she goes to ask someone.  Mostly, when she returns she will either not know or answer a different question.  She may promise a contact follow up that will not happen.  Don't worry.  Most of the time you cannot get through.  Once again, back to google and You Tube.  0/5Overall score 16/45 or 36%.  The car is great but be prepared for an unrewarding and unhelpful with Tesla as you set out on your ""customer journey"".",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Frederik,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/569001c30000ff0001fa89c4/,Rating,5,1,2,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

The customer experience at Chelmsford is how it should be - do yourself a favour and go there rather than Dartford, where they think they are doing you a favour to repair your £100k car ( even though I had a bumper to bumper guarantee which they tried to ignore).

I wanted to finance a model 3 with a 2017 Nissan Rogue as a trade in. First off the trade in value I got was really low. Only 10k they offered me and I still owed 22.500$ on the car. Yes I was crazy but tesla was my dream car and in canada the Government offers at 13k insensitive to buy the car. So it wiped out my - 12500$ I still owed and was like I was buying the car at full price.When I applied for credit on the tesla site after I did the initial 2500$ deposit purchaseIt took 3 days to get an answer witch is a bit long. So I got my first price witch they forgot to include my trade-in and I did not notice that.So I jumped up and down with happiness thinking I was getting my model 3 at a great price. When I contacted the guy at the finance department I had asked him to call me to straighten out a couple questions I had on the delivery and some fees. When he call me that's where everything went down hill.He tells me ohh no I didn't see you had a trade-in on you're account. I will have to re-submit you're application. So he did.And boy was I disappointed. He now wanted 20k down at delivery. Yes no mistake 20k what the hell I told him who asks for 20k down on a car. But he said thats what i need. I originally wanted to put 5500$ down. So we were wayyyy off.I then told him to re-check with the banks as I was sure he was not fighting enough for me as a normal F&I would. 4 days go by no answer. I then get an email from tesla with a new offer that makes more sense at 5500$ cash down and a payment that makes sense to me. I then agree to the terms and I am very happy again. Later that evening I get an email from the finance guy saying nope can't do anything for you it's the best I can do with the 20k down.I replied saying that I had already got an answer back from tesla earlier that day with a deal that totally contradicts what he just told me. So yes I get all pissed off again with them playing with my emotions like a space x rocket going back and forth lol.I go see my tesla account to go check my agreement and they had changed my finance deal to what the finace guy had just told me. All this after I had agreed to the terms. Omg was I pissed off. Thank god I took screen shots of the agreement earlier that day because I wanted to protect my own ass.So now what ? I don't know, I am 100% not going to give them 20k down because well I just don't have 20k laying around to finance a model 3. Thats what banks are for. So after all this wasted time and roller-coaster of emotions, 3 weeks later from when I first walked in and test drove the car. I have to cancel my dream car. Really sucks and they could have avoided all this if all the salesman I spoke to would have given me a better quoat from the beginning. What a waste of time.And now they are ignoring me to give back my deposit. After they waisted my time for 3 weeks.And that doesn't count the quoat I got from 5 salesman i spoke to since the beginning that all gave me wrong prices and were 400$/month off from each other.

Everybody you talk to wants to talk to a ""team"", returning a phone call in non-existent, your time is of no importance to them, and the ""Manager"" is too busy to speak to me or return my call. I actually purchased 2 model 3's and am currently trying to purchase my third. The first time I arrived early for my 7:00pm delivery appointment only to find a showroom of angry customers waiting on their new car. I finally received mine around midnight with a scrape on the front of the hood. I was told that I would be contacted to repair it. This never happened. When my tires were bald as a cucumber at 22,000 miles and I told the service person this he simply said ""that's just a salesperson being a salesperson"". I had skidded off the road because of this. When I asked for a manager he refused to come out. He was too busy. In getting my third Model 3 I accidentally pressed the wrong final payment button online and nobody at Tesla could help me. The next day when I spoke to the dealership I was told they would ""look into it"". This now Thursday and my Tesla was scheduled to be delivered on Sunday. When I called back later I was told by the person in delivery that she spoke to her manager and now was able to take care of it herself. On Friday when I called her she told me not to worry and that she was taking care of it. I returned the rental car that I had based on my conversation with her. Today (Saturday) she is telling me that it would be 3-7 days to resolve this. She then told me that her Manager would ""do me a favor"" and hold the car for me and not sell it to someone else. Boy am I lucky. This Manager as of now has yet to call me as requested. The Rep who spoke to me said that he was overloaded by Tesla and she would reach out to him again to ask him to call me.

The cars are wonderful, but the 'service' is appalling. Trying to buy one online was like pushing water uphill - trying to deal with them afterwards has been a nightmare.If you buy online, make sure that absolutely ALL information is complete and accurate, because they won't make the tiniest change afterwards. For me, this meant missing out on the free client referral miles because I missed that box when I was ordering. The code can't be added in arrears. Tesla also entered the wrong information for me as registered keeper, and then refused to change it - I am now trying to sort it out with DVLA direct but it will take 4-6 weeks because of Covid.   Collection day was terrible, but other Tesla owners had warned me that it would be. The cars are parked in narrow bays, and with other people swarming round their own cars, there was no social distancing. I didn't want to take the risk of close contact, so I am now awaiting a service appointment to correct various defects - including a very visible chip in the dashboard. The only conclusion is that the cars aren't inspected. I could go on. Suffice to say, the 'after care' and 'service' is truly the worst I have ever experienced, mainly because it's all online or via the app, with no human help. The car, however, is wonderful, and once the delivery defects have been corrected I will probably love it.

It took me over 7 months of being passed from pillar to post to get an answer from Anton Baboglo (Country Service Manager UK & IE) that Tesla had no interest in coming out to see if we could recreate what the car decided to do on 'Autopilot'; no interest whatsoever in offering any compensation for me going over 7 months without a family car and the running/depreciation costs while I waited on their answer; and that they would not even deliver the car to a friend who said he would try to sell the repaired car for me!On top of that the car arrived with deep scratches, which I had to take time out taking the car (twice) to someone at Tesla to get repaired; I was shown a video in a herd of people picking up their Tesla with no warning about the 'autosteer'; and Tesla's defence was there's a couple of lines in the manual, even though they were happy enough for me to drive away without reading the manual!These guys show through their actions that they have no care or pride in building their cars or looking after their customers.It even made zero difference that I bought one of the first Model Xs in the UK for £120,000 (by the way, in the early days of that car with so few customers, the customer service was good) ... unfortunately, there policy of pile them high and ignore customer complaints and hope they go away deserves to drive what is an incredibly innovative company out of business.Elon Musk's hype that this car could drive from West Coast to East Coast of the USA on autopilot ... well there'd be a lot of terrified other road users if he tried with my Model 3 in the state it was in late January 2020!The worst purchase decision of my life. Please take the marketing blurb and sales pitches with a pinch of salt and realise that UK customer service won't give a stuff if you have a bad/disappointing experience.p.s. My life partner inherited my Model X ... she's experiencing terrible and random functioning of the air conditioning like others who I've just browsed through here. She also let me know after that occasionally her 'autosteer' would make a random move like steer into the side of the road suddenly - she's learnt to only trust and use it on the motorway and even then she's super wary and vigilant; I wish I'd been as smart as her and had a couple of taps on the shoulder before my new Model 3 did that out of the blue.

Review,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Review/www.teslamotors.com/5f5e8f8402e8570acc373389,2020-09-13 21:30:44+00:00,First and last Tesla,"I have not previously inclined to blog about anything, but the negative experience due to the purchase of our 2020 Tesla Model Y (aka model Yugo) has inclined me to post the problems that we paid $60,000 for.As I have stated in other posts, there is a certain cool factor that goes with purchasing and driving a Tesla. There are definitely many cool features.  If you are a young driver that is impressed by features that Tesla has and can see past the many imperfections and problems, then this car is for you.  If you are an older middle aged person looking for a safe family car, I would not recommend rushing to your local Tesla showroom.  First, my personal opinion about the car is that it is definitely not a luxury car.  It does not ride like a Cadillac or Mercedes or similar car.  The turning radius is non-existent.  Not to take anything away from Toyota or Honda but it rides like a Camry or Accord, both cars I definitely like; the Camry or Accord just don’t cost $60,000.  Don’t expect a luxury car ride.The service at Tesla definitely leaves a to to be desired.  This was the first full EV that my wife and I purchased. When we took delivery of the vehicle, it was waiting for us in a parking lot.  We were instructed to sign into our phone app and just drive away.  There was no one to show us any features or explain anything about the vehicle, just a car parked in a parking lot and a phone app.  We were instructed to view a series of YouTube videos if we had any questions about anything.  Again, the app is where you communicate with Tesla about any service issues; no managers or service office to complain to if things go wrong or if something needs to be escalated.  Just an app conversation with a technician.  Office depot has far better service.  If I purchase the wrong ink cartridge, there is more attention by Office depot than Tesla toward any problems.  Once you schedule an appointment on the app, you can expect the appointment to be moved at least twice.  Totally at Tesla’s discretion.  So don’t rush to your boss’ desk to ask for time off until Tesla has decided when they have time to get to your service issues.  This can change up to the day that your service is scheduled.  Your life is entirely in their hands and don’t expect a loaner vehicle, rather they will offer you an UBER ride back home.   Again, this lack luster service might be ok with a very young person, but anyone with kids or a busy career, this is very inconvenient.  Who needs to spend $60,000 on a vehicle, only to spend the next three months or so juggling service appointments.Since we have had so many issues with our brand new 2020 Tesala, I thought a lot about how to share them all on this blog.  My wife and I have a collection of videos and photos cataloging all of the issues.  I am planning to publish a web site sometime in the future with all pictures and videos available.I do have my personal theory about why the Model Y has had so many issues.  Three weeks after we took delivery of our Tesla, the company lowered the price by $3,000.  I believe that Tesla wanted to push out as many vehicles prior to reducing the price.  I believe that this caused the Model Y to be built in a hurry and with many issues.Below is a list of all the items that my wife and I have had to deal with so far with our new Tesla.1.	Wires hanging from underneath the vehicle2.	Roof glass was not installed correctly, allowing air and water to enter the vehicle. The glass had to be adjusted.3.	The charge port door was broken, had to be replaced.  4.	Multiple exterior panels including fenders and hood needed adjusting.  The car had uneven gaps on most of the panels.  Most of the on the passenger side.  5.	Door glass had to be adjusted, also allowing water and air to enter the vehile.6.	There is a crinkle in the center of the cars hood.  My wife and I had decided to live with this, since there are so many other serious issued to resolve.7.	A very important and dangerous issue with the car was the screen.  The screen was shutting off while driving on the highway and was freezing at random times.  We stopped to check the mail and the screen stated that we were traveling 37 miles per hour.  Without the scree, there is no way of knowing how fast the vehicles is going or what gear the vehicles is in.  The screen controls everything.8.	The air conditioner randomly blew at high and would then shut off on its own.9.	After one of the service appointments the left blinker decided to stop working, leaving us without a blinker until the next appointment.  10.	Several tools were left in the vehicle following a service call.11.	Lose bolts were found by the technician at one of our appointments.12.	One tail light and two front facing lights allow water to enter, leaving fog after a rain or car wash.And many more problems.  Apparently too many to list due to the limitations of this blog.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Rudy Ramirez,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5f5e8f7ef3fdd246b7f9cafb/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

The delivery of our Model X today was unacceptable considering we have waited 1 year for it after months of continuous delays in our order by Tesla:* Scratched windshield and side exterior * Soiled interior - absolutely filthy for a new car* No contactless delivery as stated. Delivery man did not take any infection control steps such as masks, gloves. He wore filthy clothes and gloves.* Delivery man drove our car without our permission onto our driveway and forced the keys onto us and left. This happened whilst we were in discussion with Tesla Birmingham, UK.  On hearing this the customer advisor at Tesla advised us not to accept the car in its current state  * No tracking information was provided (took a day off work and had to chase up delivery times). After leaving the car, we then were sent a text message with the tracking information. This is fraudulent. Initially he claimed his phone was broken and that’s why there was no tracking information. He was later on his phone, surprise surprise.* The car was brought on a trailer by a dirty van totally unprotected, the sort of vehicle which would be used to transport a broken down vehicle to a scrapyard, not a 100k car.* Delivery man was extremely unprofessional and barely spoke or understood English. Tried to raise a complaint regarding this unsatisfactory delivery, there's not even any contact email to raise it! Absolutely AWFUL service.

I asked for Tuesday or Thursday the following week. Nothing available she told me, but we can do this afternoon or tomorrow at 5pm ( after I told her I was committed all week). Yeah sure... in the Bristol rush hour at 5pm, that would be fun for a test drive. I repeated that I could do next week or the week after. Haven't got anything next week, she replied .What nothing? Nothing she said, What about the following week? No good either. Frankly after that she seemed completely dis-interested. I felt it was that afternoon or tomorrow at 5pm, take it or leave it. Can you call me tomorrow and we can agree a mutual date in the future, I asked. OK she replied. Never heard anything since.. silence..

Despite carrying a Tesla tyre repair kit (which did not work), we have had to delay our return to the UK from Spain by 5 days until a tyre can be shipped to us (apparently no one in Spain carries the specific tyre on our Tesla X). This has been very costly. Tesla has paid for a tow truck to deliver our car to the hotel whilst we await delivery of a tyre - that is it.Our costs are as follows:- a taxi to take us to the hotel (the tow truck could only take one person; no one told us).- five nights and meals in a hotel for the family.- payment for a new crossing to the UK (we got no refund for our ferry crossing)- a new tyre.In total over €2000.A ridiculous cost for a common event that will likely happen to many Tesla drivers.Tesla’s short-sighted decision not to allow for a spare tyre or opt for roll flat tyres is a major downside and adds to the other complaints of range anxiety and poor after sales service that comes with owning this otherwise great car.

Honestly the car is nice ( can be for 118000£) but I would never buy again with the same conditions, especially not as a leasing. It is a trap you can't get out of. The car ends up costing us over 1000£ a month of leasing (+insurance of course) (this with over 20000£ upfront), in 2 years time we will have three choices: 1.give back the car (LOL) , 2. pay 55000£ to own the car fully (LOL again), 3.Sign up for another Tesla and remain lifetime customers (LOL thrice).

On more pressing issue is there is no power to the towing electrical outlet.  Of course you find that out only when you try to use it the first time.  A bit of an inconvenience.  With the number of issues I was having, I figured service would be similar to other auto dealers.  This is not the case, it is a minor miracle if you can even talk to a service representative.  I was able to make an appointment on-line through the Tesla application for about three weeks from now and it has been confirmed.

There is a learning curve to getting to know this car so please be prepared.  The service department finally called after about a 10 days of owning the car and some of the issues such as the defects in the hatchback door and back seat alignment and the fault in the hatchback autolift, the AC blowing hot air and the rattle will hopefully all be taken care of.  They could not get me scheduled for service until July 22 so I'll update again then.Update July 22, 2020: just brought car in for service after waiting 2-3 weeks to get in so that they could have a loaner car available. I had previously asked the service advisor how long it would take to check in car and get loaner car As I had a doctors appointment I needed to go to. I was told all would ready for me and would take a few minutes. Upon my arrival I was told to wait in the waiting area and they would let me know how long service would take. I asked them why the loaner car wasn’t ready for me after I had already informed them I had a doctors appointment to get to. The service guy said what loaner!

I reserved a Model S in March and yesterday ended my purchase attempts because I felt mistreated. I provide details below but suggest that Tesla ensure that it responds to customer contract inquiries within 48 hours (rather than not responding for two weeks), urge its sales force to be more proactive for its customers, and change the distinctions in free supercharging between inventory and ordered cars. Finally, if Tesla is going to take trade-ins, I urge Tesla not to have a system that its own employees call “low-balling.” On March 13, 2020, I visited your Burlingame facility and met with X, who told me that I should reserve a Model S that day to lock in free supercharging for life. X assured me that I need not take delivery for months, but that it was important to reserve then. I did reserve that day. X had told me it would be three or four weeks before the Model S would be ready; instead, on March 18, Tesla told me my Model S was available. On March 19 I received another text and a call from Y asking me to schedule delivery. I explained to Y that I didn’t have the 240 receptacle, hadn’t arranged for the cash, and I felt the trade-in offer was too low. Y indicated he would work on the trade-in value and get back to me.I received three separate texts on March 20 and two phone calls from other Tesla representatives. All of them pressured me to take delivery quickly, but none of them knew about the three issues I had discussed with Y. During one of the conversations I was told that Tesla would match a CarMax offer. I told the last Tesla representative that I did not want to accept delivery. Suggestion No. 1: Ensure coordination of information and customer communications within your sales and delivery staff. Do not tell customers it will be three to four weeks if the car will be ready within five days. No customer appreciates three separate persons pressuring the customer to take delivery when the second two have no idea about the concerns the customer explained to the first one. A simple contact database with notes of each call would help as other businesses use. This was an unpleasant experience. After turning down delivery on April 3 (which was too soon after I had declined on March 20), I received a text on May 29 that my Model S would be delivered in mid-to-late June. The text stated that “Model S has recently been updated pricing and has been automatically updated for your order.” I replied yes to the text. I went to my Tesla account only to find that contrary to the text the contract price was still the original higher price; the $5,000 reduction had not been applied. I spoke with X on June 1. X said he would put in a “case” to Tesla to correct the price. A few days later, June 4, I made an appointment to test drive the Model Y (since it has side pockets and a large center console as the Model S infamously does not after all these years) with Z at the Burlingame facility. When I arrived Z was busy, so A helped me out. When I told A that Tesla had not carried through on the promise in its May 29 text to reduce the price of my Model S, he told me that if I got the reduced price for the Model S I would not have free supercharging. That was frustrating because it was the reason I had paid the $100 to reserve the Model S in March. I called X again and asked him to ensure that I retained free supercharging and asked how the case was going. He responded that “order” had not responded. After that I called X almost daily about Tesla’s response. X frequently was not available, so I ended up speaking with B, C, D (June 9), Y (June 10), X (June 11), and A (June 12). (I only know who I spoke to on those later dates because I began to take notes). D told me that as of June 9 the order desk still had not responded and promised to ping them for me. Y and X told me the same thing. By June 12, 12 days after X submitted the request, Tesla had not responded about the promised reduction in price. I decided not to purchase a car from Tesla. From my customer’s perspective and opinion, I was mistreated, pressured to take delivery in March and again in June when both times I had issues, the first time with my situation and the second time with Tesla’s refusal to provide the promised $5,000 reduction in price. Tesla promised to reduce the price but never delivered on the promise, keeping me hanging for two weeks. Tesla made a trade-in offer that was $7,000 less than its previous offer and $5,000 below a current CarMax offer.

At 68, I have purchased a number of cars in my lifetime, and not once have I experienced such disgusting, disrespectful  business practices.

Approaching 1000 miles (early days). The detailed research and tax breaks got me into the car, the one thing I noted in the internet haze was how many people loved the car, whatever the issues. Like any company I had to remember most people are only vocal when something goes wrong. Now, the collection was poor. It took a couple of goes and I refused the first time. It was just at the point of lockdown so some credit for this. But not great. The build does not feel like a German car but, it is pretty good. Panel alignment and paint can be complaints. This car is not a traditional interior with leather and a million buttons. It is a minimalist car and interior and you need to like this. I do. The car is amazing. I love the look of it, and it gets lovely compliments, the charging network is superb, and a real stoke of Tesla genius to avoid the public charging pitfalls. No emissions of course was a big thing for me. The car’s handling with the battery weight at the bottom is superb, firm, but pleasant. The speed needs managing as these model 3’s currently can be 0-60 in under 4 secs, just over for mine. The acceleration is impressive when needed.  And then there is the tech. Wow. This car seems miles ahead. Over the air software updates and upgrades. Amazing developing self-drive (which needs to be understood) as this is not currently self-driving. The battery tech and functions are incredible. This is a techie car. It is like owning a flash smart phone on wheels! These are tech people 1st, carmakers 2nd (but the gap is closing). I am hoping the German factory will up their game. The car has had a minor trim issue which was fixed by a “ranger” on my drive. The ranger was excellent. Otherwise there is no service schedule as very little to do. So, it is not perfect, and it is not for everyone (do your research carefully to see if it’s for you). But like many folks I know, I love it. The drive, style and tech appear unbeatable at the moment. It is not 1000 miles in for me, so will try and update in the future, and if the wheels fall off, but so far, so much better than good.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Jason Green,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/4fff293d00006400011d19b4/,Rating,5,1,4,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

I've had my S 75 RWD since Dec 2017. I've driven over 26k relatively trouble free miles including a recent 2k round trip to the Italian Alps & back last Winter. Tesla's coupe d'etat is their supercharging network, it is second to none & I didn't need do any trip planning beyond a distance map on A Better Route Planner to work out where to book overnight & expect meal stops. The in-car navigation system handled getting us from door-to-door admirably. When permitted, we also drive all over the UK and often go on impromptu day trips which we would never have done in my old car due to cost of petrol. We use the supercharger network whenever we do this, we've never had to use another public charging system, & there is zero inconvenience .. we simply stop for food as we would have to do anyway & plug the car in. The car is usually ready to go before we are! In general day-to-day use we charge at home from solar power where we can or low cost overnight electricity from a renewable supplier where we can't. I can even top-up, for free, when I go shopping as Tesco has multiple free-to-use PodPoint chargers.My car is a joy to drive. I have the performance of a BMW M3 (mine is a ""slow"" Tesla), Spotify on tap for music, TuneIn for podcasts, a HEPA filter to deal with city pollution, funky country smells & hayfever then AutoPilot to top it all take the strain on long motorway journeys. All the while cruising along in serene silence emitting zero CO2. I have an app to allow me to heat or cool my car remotely, to let someone into my car & drive it if I need them to even if I'm in another part of the world & I receive regular software updates that add features that my car didn't have when I bought it (a built in dashcam, a video alarm system, ""dog mode"" to allow animals/people/cream cakes to stay in the car on hot/cold days and maintain the temperature, a multitude of in-car games).I have taken my car to a local HEVRA garage to have it checked over for roadworthy-ness twice, Tesla do not mandate servicing but I feel an annual mechanical check-up is wise. I've not had to change my wiper blades, tyres, brake pads or brake discs (despite having attended 2 separate runway days to safely see just how fast my car will go (140mph) and to test the handling on very wiggly sprint circuits); I've had the HEPA filter cleaned and the pollen filter changed; I have had to top up my screen wash several times .. the costs have been minimal.I've had some warranty claims which have usually been resolved quickly and with minimal fuss, usually by a mobile technician at a place of my choosing, work or home. Issues have been: some cabin rattles/squeaks (you wouldn't have noticed these in a petrol/diesel vehicle due to engine noise), some wind noise (again, would not have been noticeable in a none electric vehicle), a failed bonnet solenoid (manual unlatching was still possible), a steering rack squeak (more grease required) and a seat pad which mysteriously discoloured.I've deducted 1 star as there is always room for improvement & customer communication from Tesla could be better. Because of this they tend to seem a little disorganised when it comes to vehicle collection/service even if, in actual fact, things as far as they're concerned, are all good.So, I would recommend Tesla but with the caveat of they are a tech company making electric vehicles, not a car company trying to do an EV. Tesla will sell you a car in the same way that Apple will sell you a phone .. don't expect them to flatter your ego on the way. If you like buttons & traditional cabins with dealers that fawn over you whilst trying to get an up-sell of some sort, then they won't be for you. If you are a bit of a tech geek willing to accept a bit of rough-round-the-edges while they get it right, well, you won't find a faster ""milk float"" ;)",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Sara Helme,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5ee203451af62754f6b35b20/,Rating,5,1,4,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

I filling the information account and then the system ask me for the credit card information. I was building a car basically in my first time login to this Tesla website I wasn't realized that at the end says thank you for you order you car will be start to be build. In less than 30 minutes I call to cancel this order and request a refund for $100 that I get charged and representative on that day said that I will be refunded back to my bank account in about 4 to 7 business day. Today I still waiting and when I call back now the representative Britney says that ""I'm sorry"" but that fee It's not refundable. Everything happens in 15 minutes and they just take $100 from me. That treatment for this people in Tesla honestly makes me feel stupid. I don't need to call for $100 but this It's not fair.

The state I was registering in is a self registration state and this should NOT affect the actual purchase of the car as the bank owns the title not Tesla. On top of that if I had a co-signer they would have to have the same license as myself which is literally impossible as it was my sister who now lives in a different state.

I ordered a Model Y vehicle in March. The sales rep assured me that my deposit was 100% refundable up until delivery. I wanted to make sure this was the case as this model has not been released yet and I want to test drive it before committing to it. She also told me that I could make any changes to my order online. I couldn’t decide between two colours, and she assured me that I could change it online if I wanted to. A couple of weeks later I decide that I wanted to change the colour. I went online to do so, and was then sent an updated invoice. I was very surprised that it came with a $3600 price increase. There was no price difference in colours, so I asked my rep for an explanation. The rep I placed the order with is no longer with the company, so I’ve been dealing with someone else. He told me that because the price of the vehicle changed between the date I placed the order and the date I made the colour change, I was responsible for the new price. I told him that that was not explained to me, and something I specifically asked about when I made the order and gave the deposit. I’ve asked him to provide me the contact details for his supervisor five times and he is yet to provide this. I can’t just go in right now due to COVID-19, so my only option is to call/email. I can’t find any contact details online other than a generic sales email address. The response I keep getting from my rep is that they won’t honour the original price I agreed to. I will be cancelling my order, though reading other reviews here, I’m very concerned about getting my money back. At a time of such economic uncertainty, you’d think that a company like this would go above and beyond for their clients. I’ll be taking my business somewhere that does.

I've purchased many cars in my life and this was by far the worst. First, they offer no discounts at all of any kind, not even a military discount. I can look past this, but it is a negative. The next issue is that their salesmen and processes are so disconnected and disjointed from the way any other dealerships work. We got our own loan and the bank we financed through had many issues trying to get any documents from Tesla. Tesla wanted their process only and would not do it any other way. My sales advisor (basically the salesman) provided conflicting information and at times wouldn't even reply to my email. When I called him on his company phone, I left a voicemail due to no answer. Instead of calling me, he emailed me back, which makes zero sense! I would have emailed him the first time if that's what I wanted. Tesla requires an MVPA (Motor Vehicle Purchasing Agreement) in order to process the purchase. I asked my Tesla advisor to explain it to me which he did well enough with. It all made sense on what needed to be done; fill out and send to my bank, so I did. After placing my order online for my Model S, I received a message from Tesla stating to fill out the MVPA and send it back to a specific Tesla email address and that the vehicle would be ready early the next week (surprise, it wasn't!). I told my sales advisor that I had filled it out and sent it and he rudely reiterated what the MVPA was for and that it only needed sent to my bank, which is conflicting from the Tesla message I received. I didn't need ANOTHER explanation of the MVPA, especially in a rude manner.I stayed in contact with my bank over the following days to ensure the funds got transferred but they were still missing some documents from Tesla, so I once again talked to my sales advisor and he said none of the remaining documentation is sent to the bank until I pick up the vehicle. Even their own website (where you can view the status of your order) says that they will not release the vehicle to you until the funding is received by Tesla. Once again, conflicting information. And who let's someone have a car before funds are even received?! I talked to my bank and they were even blown away by this process but they told me it's ultimately up to the dealership.The used Model S I purchased was in a storage location not even 30 minutes from the Tesla pickup location where I would take possession of the vehicle, yet my advisor said it would take 5-7 business days before I could even pickup. How does it take that long even if the storage location is a third party company?! Due to the Corona virus situation, this causes a lot of issues with work/school schedules. I can go to a car dealership today and walk out with a new vehicle same day. I could see if I was ordering a brand new Tesla Model S, but not a used vehicle that is located minutes down the road and ready to go. The biggest issue with this not so much the wait, but the fact that Tesla requires you to upload proof of insurance. So I'm paying for insurance on a vehicle I don't even own yet. And Tesla coverage is NOT cheap.The final issue I had was that my advisor said that they will not send the required documents for funding until after I pickup the vehicle. Guess what!? This is false. I talked to my bank and they said they received the documents and that they wired the funding to Tesla already. So now I'm not only paying for insurance, but now I'm paying on a vehicle I don't even own yet! Fantastic work Tesla!Overall the experience has been absolutely terrible. If you're willing to deal with it, then I would definitely recommend Tesla vehicles.

Combined with this was a reminder to pay 7 days pre delivery. We were subsequently “unmatched “ from this vehicle.Since then I have emailed on 3 occasions and have not even received the courtesy of an acknowledgement let alone an explanation or apology.Having eventually been able to talk to an uninformed office junior yesterday I was assured that somebody senior would contact me soon.Needless to say I am still waiting.At best these people are incompetent and certainly seem to be putting customers off.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Almatt,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5e73ee7d4c154f76db2f905e/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

The car is amazing and the pain and stress of dealing with Tesla thankfully melted away on the drive home. However, the service is truly and quite surprisingly terrible! Without comparison the worst customer service I have ever experienced! You simply cannot speak to anybody at Tesla. If you phone they just put you on hold and then eventually cut you off. They don’t respond to emails or customer contact forms on their website. We had an appointment to collect our car and had to wait over 45 minutes to be seen with not a single apology or explanation. It’s really surprising for an American company selling a premium product via online ordering. You would have thought they would pride themselves on customer service and unparalleled communication. I really hope they sort it out and it’s not their undoing! No way they’ll compete with the likes of Audi, BMW and Mercedes when their electric cars catch up. I also really hope I don’t have any problems with the car because I dread to think what their service department is like!",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Hamish Duncan,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5e729400dffcf724598d812c/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

I was on very low electricity at Tesla Brent Cross, so I couldn’t get to another supercharger elsewhere, they have taken back 5 slow chargers because they want to sell cars but they don’t care about the customer.They switched off the electricity of the charger that I was on. I was waiting for a supercharger but considering there are only 2, it can take an hour. So instead of them helping they wouldn’t turn on the electricity, this meant I couldn’t move my car. What they should have done considering I was now on a Tesla space for 1/2 hour was to allow me to charge until a supercharger came free.You used to be able to talk to someone on the phone if there was a problem now without warning they switched off their phones.Even the manager didn’t care.Great car but appalling service.",,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.teslamotors.com,Person,Hayley,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5b2a01e64de5666d3413f417/,Rating,5,1,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1

Bought a new model 3 dual motor. Had a paint defect on drivers side mirror they tried to polish it out with no affect the rear spoiler was hanging off they said they were aware of this but didnt tell me. I noticed a ripple on the rear offside inside door trim when i got home, contacted them to be told i must have done it. Condensation in the rear light clusters was told this is acceptable. The radio and usb music does not come on every time you return to the car. Steering creaks when turning. Car does not open everytime using my phone, i have to unlock my phone for it to open.Car great to drive but customer support and distance you have to travel to a service centre make it a joke.
